<p>The last third of the XIX - early XX century. characterized by the further development of industrial society in the leading countries of the world. During this period, industrial production grew almost threefold. The most rapidly developing Germany, who pressed even the global leader in England. Between the two countries broke out competition in the economy and the political sphere.</p>
<p>Expanding industrialization demanded new forms of organization of production and large financial investments. Financial and material resources concentrated in the hands of a small group of bankers and industrialists, called "financial oligarchy". Using his position, they monopolized the industry and played a crucial role in political life.</p>
<p>Monopoly - is the establishment of an entrepreneur or group of entrepreneurs control over one or more branches of production in order to increase profits and eliminate competition. Monopolization was a serious test of the principle of market economy - free competition. However, the monopolization not destroy competition, it only postponed it to another plane, unfolding struggle between monopolistic associations at the global market.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of industry led, on the one hand, the expansion of the internal market and on the other - contributed to the growth of foreign trade, which is based on the improvement of transport was an important factor in economic life. National producers done a bit crowded in the domestic market, and they sought to conquer new markets. This led to an aggravation of international relations. Restrictions on trade, the desire of producers to reduce the cost of goods led to the emergence of a new phenomenon - the export of capital. This contributed to the final formation of the world market, the dominant role which occupied European countries, including Britain, France, Belgium and Germany.</p>
<p>Formation of the global economic system based on the expansion of European capital is often carried out by violent means. At the turn of XIX - XX centuries. the process of establishment of colonial empires. Largest and most abundant of which was British. An important prerequisite for this situation in England was its domination of the seas. No country in the world could not even compare to her naval power. However, this situation has caused dissatisfaction England Germany which rapidly nahanyaly "possessor of the Seas" and demanded its part of colonial possessions.</p>
<p>So at the end of the XIX century. the world has developed a fundamentally new system of relations that led to the formation of political-military alliance of leading nations of the world to protect and win the world championship. The first step in this direction has made Germany, that straining to world domination. It became clear that the League of the Three Emperors (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), established in 1873, is unsustainable and does not provide the aspirations of Germany. In 1879 it was concluded the Austro-German alliance, and in 1882 Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy entered into a Triple Alliance. Formation in central Europe threatened the interests of the powerful alliance of France and Russia, in response to the 1891-1893 biennium. Drew up their own union.</p>
<p>Remained one big powers - Britain, the position of which depended advantage of some of the blocks.</p>
<p>At the end of the XIX century. England still pursuing a policy of "brilliant isolation" (indirect interference in the affairs of European countries). The only concern England was its colonial empire. Kept tense relations with France because of the distribution of colonies in Africa and Asia. In 1902, signed the Anglo-Japanese alliance directed against Russia, which gave Japan the opportunity to win the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War. However, in British political circles growing realization that the greatest danger for England comes from Germany, which stood in the way of preparation for war for the redivision of the world. In particular, Germany began construction of the mighty ocean fleet. Since the Anglo-German rivalry in economic and military sphere has led to the revision of foreign policy of England. In 1904 she signs a secret agreement with France ("soft-hearted consent" - Entente) and in 1907 - Anglo-Russian Convention.</p>
<p>The main content of the policy of the great powers in the composition of these alliances was to prepare for World War II for the redistribution of already divided world. The first such war began in the late XIX century .: Spanish-American (1898), the Anglo-Boer (1899-1902.), The Russo-Japanese (1904-1905.) Italo- Turkish (1911-1912). . Besides war broke out and serious international crises, and Moroccan (1905), Bosnian (1908), the Second Moroccan (1911), Balkan (1912 - 1913).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the world's own nation many wars, Europe was in relative peace (from 1871 to 1914). Only the troubled Balkans called "powder keg" of Europe.</p>
<p>Despite the revolution XVIII - XIX centuries. Europe remained much the past. Therefore, in the internal affairs of the governments of the leading countries of Europe concerned about power struggle between supporters of the monarchy, republic, social reform and more. In this fight happened formation principles of European democracy.</p>
<p>In political life continued to play a leading role the old aristocracy. But the completion of the formation of industrial society in the leading countries led out into the political arena-operation as an important political force. The natural desire of workers to guarantee their relative social stability has created a massive labor and social movements, of which the dominant ideology in the second half of XIX - early XX century. was Marxism.</p>
<p>By the beginning of XX century. labor movement has made significant progress in ensuring social and political rights of the working class. Almost all countries have established trade unions and social democratic parties, which coordinate their activities within the Second International, which appeared in 1889 to replace the First International (1864-1889 gg.).</p>
<p>Under its pressure in the West started the "era of reformism." Its initiators were mostly liberal parties. Thanks to the reforms in the years 1871-1914 was achieved relative social peace, established the first social insurance system, strengthened democratic institutions, laid the foundation for state regulation of social and economic processes.</p>
