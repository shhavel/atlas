<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. Elimination of Ukrainian autonomous principalities</b></p>
<p>During the reign of Vytautas (1392-1430 gg.) Many Lithuanian princes, who had portions of Rus-Ukraine, was deprived of possessions.</p>
<p>Autonomy of autonomous principalities concerned about the Grand Duke. For strengthening and consolidation of his power, he made every effort to eliminate the largest principality urivnyaty princes of the nobility.</p>
<p>The elimination of feudal principalities for prince layers mean restricting their rights.</p>
<p>Against this policy together Vitebsk Prince Svydryhajlo Olgerdovich, Seversky Prince Dmitry Olgerdovich-Korbut, Kyiv prince Volodymyr Olgerdovich and Podolsky Prince Fedor Koriatovich.</p>
<p>These princes were subordinate to their new lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The confrontation escalated into a military conflict in which the princes were defeated.</p>
<p>Earth Dmitry Korybut-handed Duke Vytautas Theodore Lyubartovychu, in which before were selected Volyn his fiefdom.</p>
<p>Could not keep the portion Koriatovich and Theodore, who ruled on the tail after the death of his three brothers. This Duke Vytautas deprived of principalities, too, in 1393</p>
<p>Year 1394 he drove out of the earth Volodymra Olgerdovich and conveyed this portion of his brother Skyrhaylu.</p>
<p>And ruled in Kiev Skyrhaylo Olgerdovich briefly: the chronicle story, soon he was poisoned. Established in Kyiv Prince Ivan Olhymuntovych Golshansky.</p>
<p>Thus, during the 1393-1395 biennium. Principalities were deprived of the most significant rulers.</p>
<p><b>Duke Vytautas policy aimed at eliminating autonomy largest portion blow Ukrainian state, as it is separate principalities statist idea embodied in the lands of Rus-Ukraine, who were in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</b></p>
<p><b>2. Strengthening the Polish influence on Ukrainian land</b></p>
<p>Yea, as opposed Vytautas Krevsk Union, oppose the strengthening of the Polish influence he could not.</p>
<p>Find support Vytautas in Poland led the defeat in the battle against the Tatars in 1399 on the river Vorskla.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, signed in Vilnius in 1401, Vytautas was considered life ruler of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but after the death of all his land had to return to Poland.</p>
<p>It was restored condition Krevsk Union. However Vytautas eventually returned to its former glory. Especially noticeable increase its credibility after the Battle of Grunwald, which was dealt a devastating blow to the Knights of the Teutons (1410).</p>
<p>Winning the Battle of Grunwald forced the Polish magnates agreed to significant concessions Lithuanians. This influenced the fate of Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>Year 1411 the Polish king Jagiello gave Vytautas life tenancy in Western skirts.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the agreement entered into in 1412 in Lyuboml Hungary refused to Poland and Lithuania on its claims to Galicia and Podolia. Under the agreement possess these Ukrainian lands could not only Poles, but the Lithuanians.</p>
<p><b>Horodelska Union</b></p>
<p>Changes in the Polish-Lithuanian relations was confirmed in October 1413 on the common Diet in Horodli.</p>
<p>Then it was approved Horodelska union, which again confirmed the Polish-Lithuanian convergence, while proclaiming the preservation of the grand table in Lithuania.</p>
<p>That is, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was fixed some state law, though under the auspices of the Polish king.</p>
<p>For new Ukrainian lands of the Polish-Lithuanian agreement had an undesirable result: it is, in particular, provides for appointments to senior government positions Grand Duchy of Lithuania only Lithuanian Catholics, which greatly limited the rights of Ukrainian Orthodox nobility which to achieve public office had to renounce their ancestral faith, and thus - and nationality.</p>
<p><b>3. Rise of the Lithuanian-Ruthenian nobles led by Prince Svidrigaylo</b></p>
<p>After the death of Vytautas in 1430 Grand Duke of Lithuania was proclaimed Prince Svydrygailo Olgerdovich.</p>
<p>It is much more active than its predecessor launched a policy aimed at breaking the union with Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania gaining independence.</p>
<p>In response to Poland, which is generally preferred not to have the Grand Duke of Lithuania, began hostilities.</p>
<p>Orientation Svydrygailo Ukrainian and Belarusian nobility caused discontent Lithuanians, and with the support of Poland Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas was proclaimed brother - Sigismund.</p>
<p>Removing Svydrygailo from power in 1432 angered supporters of the prince.</p>
<p>They refused to recognize the authority of Sigismund, who restored the union with Poland.</p>
<p>According to the chronicler, "n princes and boyars Prince put Svydrygailo the great principality of Rus'.</p>
<p>Contemporaries interpreted this event as a division of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into two states - Lithuanian and Ruthenian.</p>
<p>The latter, researchers sometimes call her Ukrainian-Belarusian State entered Kyiv region, Chernihiv-Siverschyna, Volyn, Eastern Podolia, Smolensk, Polotsk and Vitebschyna.</p>
<p>Over the next few years Polish and Lithuanian nobles, who relied on Poland, attempted to subdue by force of arms and return Svydrygailo Russian lands under the rule of Grand Duke of Lithuania.</p>
<p>Events that determined the fate of the uprising Svydrygailo was Battle of Wilkomierz (now Ukmerge Lithuania).</p>
<p>Battle at Vilkomyrom held in 1435</p>
<p>In that battle came the army of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund, reinforced by Polish troops, and the army Svydrygailo, who led the Ukrainian-Belarusian nobility in fighting for their rights.</p>
<p>Svydrygailo forces suffered a heavy defeat.</p>
<p><b>Rise of the Grand Duchy of Rus against Poland and pro-Polish and Lithuanian prokatolytsky minded tribal nobility after an unsuccessful battle had no chance of winning.</b></p>
<p><b>4. Restoration and final liquidation of Kyiv and Volyn autonomous principalities</b></p>
<p>However, even almost 100 years members of the Ukrainian aristocracy resisted the encroachments of those in power Lithuanian Catholics and Poland.</p>
<p>Thus, in 1440 Volyn Prince John and Alexander Czartoryski family organized a conspiracy and killed the Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Ukrainian lands rebellion broke out against Lithuania.</p>
<p>They have gained such strength and magnitude that Lithuanian rulers had to restore the unit Kyiv and Volyn principality. Kyiv Prince was Olelko (Alexander), son Vytautas remove Olgerdovich Prince Vladimir of Kiev, Volyn - Svidrigailov.</p>
<p><b>Olelkovichey</b></p>
<p>Olelko Vladimirovich (1441-1454 gg.) And his son Simon Olelkovich (1455-1470 gg.) Continued to Kiev Vladimir Olgerdovich policy table.</p>
<p>In addition to Kyiv, Pereyaslav and Bratslavshchina possession Olelkovichey spread to Chernihiv-Siver land.</p>
<p>Much has been made for the defense of the earth, including the added reinforcement frontier castles - Liubech, island, Kanev, Cherkassy, ​​Zvenigorod more.</p>
<p>Opened the restoration of Kiev churches: Church of the Savior on Berestove Assumption Cathedral of Kiev-Pechersk Monastery.</p>
<p><b>However, the strengthening of Ukrainian principalities contrary policy of Lithuania and Poland. Therefore restored Duchy was again eliminated: Volyn in 1452, after the death Svydrygailo and Kiev - 1471, after the death of Simeon Olelkovichey.</b></p>
<p><b>Earth liquidated principalities were transferred Lithuanian governors, what actually establishes the domination of foreigners.</b></p>
<p><b>5. "Conspiracy Russian princes"</b></p>
<p>The elimination of feudal principalities protests Russian princes.</p>
<p>Year 1481 descendants of Vladimir Olgerdovich Michael Olelkovich, Theodore Belsky and John Golshansky conspired to remove from power the Lithuanian Grand Duke Casimir, who was both a king of Poland, but instead put on the Grand table Olelkovichey Michael.</p>
<p>However, the plot was exposed. Execution Olelkovichey Jr. put the last point in the life of an independent principality of Kiev, because since the chronicler wrote, "Kiev ceased to be rulers and princes were instead of governor."</p>
<p>The next and, indeed, the last attempt to restore the independence of the Ukrainian lands by force of arms from the princes was the uprising Michael Glinski in 1508, but it failed.</p>
<p>Thus, attempts to preserve Ukrainian aristocracy Ukrainian statehood were not successful. The elimination of feudal principalities for prince layers meant losing the state status, whose support she performed.</p>
<p>During the XV - beginning of the XVII century. rulers tried to prevent the consolidation at important positions, the government, as it was then called untitled nobility.</p>
<p>With the strengthening of the Polish influence among the candidates have an advantage, especially in the crown lands Catholics.</p>
<p>This fact forced to move to the Catholic religion princely family. Contributed to this and intermarriage with representatives of the Polish magnate families.</p>
<p>Yes Ukrainian and Belarusian lands gradually lost prince layer.</p>
<p>And without a national elite, able to hold public office, that represent the state, the state-interrupted tradition.</p>
