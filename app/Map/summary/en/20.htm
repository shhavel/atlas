<p>The presence of a large resource base and stable demand for products resulted in the formation of the chemical industry as a strong component of the economy of the state. Mining and basic chemistry, chemistry of organic synthesis, pharmaceutical and microbiological industry uses oil, gas, coal, waste, wood for production, which is widely used in industry and everyday life.</p>
<p>Our mining and chemical industries represented in Kalush, Stebnyk (potassium salt), Slavic, Artemivsk, Solotvino (salt), New Rozdol, sycamore (sulfur) and focused on raw materials.</p>
<p>Production of basic chemistry is very useful to the national economy fertilizers, acids, soda. Production of potash tends to raw materials (Kalush, Stebnyk), nitrogen - to coking and steel companies and pipelines (Gorlivka, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy), phosphate - to areas of agricultural production (Cherkassy, ​​Sumy, Odessa). Production of soda is concentrated in areas where raw materials - salt (Donbass, Crimea).</p>
<p>Oriented energy, water and raw materials (gas, coal, oil), organic synthesis chemistry is represented by in Odessa, Berdyansk (plastics), Kiev, Cherkassy (chemical fiber), Dnepropetrovsk, White Church (rubber), varnishing and painting industries Kyiv, Lviv, Odessa, Dnipropetrovsk, Melitopol, Chernivtsi.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical (drugs), microbiological (vitamins, supplements) industry gravitate to markets and are located mainly in large cities (Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, Lubni).</p>
<p>The chemical industry, like all farm country, takes a lot of money on upgrades. Particularly acute is the issue of environmental pollution industry. And in the case of complex decision problems related to increasing the productivity and competitiveness of products, the introduction of low-waste and non-waste technology, the chemical industry will be one of the most profitable components of the economy.</p>
