<p>According to scientists, the Earth as a planet originated about 4.5 billion years ago. However, for a long time, almost a billion years, it remained dead. Living beings contain protein, so life could arise only if the prevailing conditions under which the protein is not destroyed. Such conditions are formed in shallow sea due to simple physical and chemical processes about 3.5 billion years ago. The first living organisms differed utmost simplicity of structure. They are not divided into plants and animals and nourished exclusively organic matter. Only later, in the course of evolution, some organisms have acquired the ability to absorb solar energy, recycle carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and build organic matter in your body, thus releasing oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis, without further development of life on Earth would be impossible. Gradually organisms were improved and 450 million years ago, some of them came to the land, thus formed a complete shell of existence of living matter on the planet - the biosphere. Organisms that affect the environment gradually adapt to its changes. Some groups of plants and animals were replaced by others. Biosphere, living organisms that constitute it, made possible the emergence of man.</p>
<p>Biosphere - very thin and fragile shell. It gets to 11 thousand. M deep into the ocean, a few hundred meters of the crust and does not exceed the ozone layer in the atmosphere. Thus the biosphere is placed in the lower part of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and the entire upper part of the lithosphere. This spacious living, evolving and played constantly changing, more than 2 million. Species of living organisms, which are combined into four kingdoms of nature: plants (about 500 thousand. Species), animals (1.5 million species), fungi ( over 100 thousand. species) and microorganisms.</p>
<p>Before the advent of life on Earth consisted of single membrane lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. During its existence, the biosphere has shaped the changing gas balance of the atmosphere, hydrosphere salt composition and formation of the parent rock (the top layer of the lithosphere) soils. Due to living organisms became possible existence of geographic shell that covers the space available for living organisms. The boundaries of the geographic shell coincide with the boundaries of the biosphere. Despite the geographical integrity of the membrane, environmental conditions it is quite diverse. Geographical cover can be divided into fairly homogeneous in terms of natural areas - natural systems.</p>
<p>There azonal zonal and natural systems. The largest zonal natural systems are geographic zones, which often extends in a latitudinal direction from the equator to the poles. Since climate is a major factor in shaping the geographical zones, their number and names correspond to climatic zones. However, due to the fact that in addition to climate defining characteristic geographical zones is also soil and vegetation, inland waters, topography, boundaries of the geographic and climatic zones are not always the same. At the same time, each geographical area characterized same temperature conditions and atmospheric circulation.</p>
<p>Smaller natural systems, which is characterized by the similarity of temperature conditions, moisture, soil, flora and fauna is a natural area. Since the main characteristics of the natural environment natural area is strongly dependent on incoming solar energy and, ultimately, the climatic conditions, natural areas vary from the equator to the poles. However, like the climatic conditions, natural areas are not distributed perfectly geographical latitude: their placement significantly influenced by other factors, including the importance of playing terrain. In highland areas characterized by high-altitude zone - changing natural systems, depending on the altitude.</p>
<p>Natural areas vary in sequence. Near the poles, where year-round kept low temperature zone formed polar deserts. Development of vegetation here and avoidance of animals have powered mosses, lichens and animals that live in the cold waters of the polar parts of the oceans.</p>
<p>To the south arctic desert zone is a zone of tundra.</p>
<p>It occupies a huge area covered with marshes on the surface permafrost. Of the plants appear dwarf trees, but the main feature is its bezlissya tundra. Winter snowy tundra turns into desert. Gradually south tundra turns into boreal forest.</p>
<p>Even closer to the equator stretching zone forests.</p>
<p>Significant rainfall, higher temperatures favor the development of woody vegetation. There are growing conifers (spruce, larch), and south and deciduous (birch, aspen) trees. Mixed forests occupy the northern part of Ukraine.</p>
<p>South zone forests narrow strip stretching zone forest and steppe. In summer the climate is dry and hot. Winter is not enough snow. The vegetation is mostly herbaceous, because of the trees is not enough moisture. Today steppes almost entirely under cultivation, since in this area formed one of the most fertile soil - black.</p>
<p>In tropical latitudes lie coasts and semi-desert areas. The climate here is the hottest and most droughty. Sometimes in the summer the temperature reaches 50 Â° C. Vegetation, due to lack of moisture is very poor or non-existent. From the scorching rays of the sun are small animals hidden deep in burrows.</p>
<p>The closer to the equator, the more rain. Mostly they fall in summer. It promotes the growth of tall grasses, the presence of which is characteristic of the zone and savannah woodlands. Trees grow singly or in small groups separate. In the dry season the grass withers, the trees shed their leaves. The presence of lush grass vegetation contributes place of living of many species of large animals.</p>
<p>On both sides of the equator formed zone of humid forests. The climate is humid and hot. The flora is very diverse forms almost impenetrable thickets. Rich and varied are and fauna. Equatorial forests are often referred to as the lungs of our planet, because they produce large amounts of oxygen. This raises the need to preserve the rainforest intact.</p>
