<p>The study of geography is impossible without a geographical map, which contains the most accurate and objective information about the area uncluttered, placement of natural, economic, or social objects and phenomena.</p>
<p>On this map fuller than on other maps in the atlas, representing geographic objects (islands, peninsulas, bays, straits, seas, etc.). "Physical Map" gives an idea of ​​the major landforms of land and seabed. It presents orographic name (landforms): mountains, plains, individual vertices with their altitude above sea level, as well as the names of landforms of the ocean floor - troughs, ridges, depressions, etc.</p>
<p>The hydrographic base maps provided by rivers, freshwater and saline lakes, waterfalls, that allows us to estimate the economic use of land water. Thanks shown currents can draw conclusions about differences in climate within the climatic zones. Also shown are the deserts, wetlands, salt marshes, sand, active volcanoes, signed names of geographical areas (Llanos, Selvac etc.).</p>
<p>Comparison of this map with the political will to generalize an idea of ​​landscape (plain or mountain) prevailing in a particular country, and the comparison with the map "population distribution" will answer the question of why some areas are densely populated, and others - not populated.</p>
<p>Comparing this map with the map "Mineral resources" can be traced to the relationship of landforms with mineral deposits of different origin (sedimentary, igneous, and the like).</p>
<p>This card is used in the preparation of the characteristics of natural resources, as well as in the regional review in assessing the natural resource potential of the country.</p>
