<p>Map Education & Science gives an idea of ​​the cost of education in the state of the world (as a percentage of GDP of the country), as well as the proportion of pupils and students in the population of individual countries. More revealing is the share of people with higher (university) education. In industrialized countries the figure is an average of 19% and in developing countries - 1%. In industrialized countries, a thousand residents account for an average of 85 scientists and technicians in Sweden - 262, and in developing countries - only 9.</p>
<p>High educational level of the population identifies potential opportunities to develop knowledge-intensive industries, which in turn determines the position of the state in the international division of labor. Yes, Brazil growth rate the number of students is one of the best among developing countries. Scientific and technological potential of the country is growing. Brazil currently exports its technology abroad, provides technical and advisory services to many other countries.</p>
<p>The scope of research and deployment of scientific and engineering institutions affect the territorial structure of the economy of countries and regions. Over the past decade there was a whole network of cities for which research and design work is a major feature, the so-called science and technology and research parks, innovation centers, techno. Science Park - is located on the university campus, where the conditions for research and development of advanced technologies that integrate laboratory and university research groups and industrial companies specializing in high-tech industries. An example is Antipolis science park Sophia in France, Oxford, UK, Berkeley, Oakland in the US.</p>
<p>Technopolis become in many countries a kind of scientific growth poles, where a large regional innovation systems, for example in the area of ​​Tsukuba Japan, Russia - Dubna, Silicon Valley in the United States, Cambridge Science Park, around which there was the largest in the UK technopolis.</p>
