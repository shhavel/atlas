<p>The map is based on a mosaic of multispectral satellite images satellite Landsat 4TM and is an illustration of what opportunities open up in the study of the Earth's modern scientific and technological achievements.</p>
<p>This map at first sight - just a beautiful card, really very informative. Sufficiently high resolution enables even inexperienced user, if desired, to get a lot of interesting information. So a small amount of clouds on a peninsula at the time of the shooting enough characteristic for most of the Crimea as a dry region of the country. A predominant placement of their number on the southern coast and the complete absence in the west corresponds well with the climatic maps, illustrating how these regions, respectively, the least and most dry regions of Crimea.</p>
<p>On the map are well read area cultivated farmland. A change in the color palette of orange-red to green in the west to the east shows that the period of ripening crop goes in the direction of the sultry west to east cooler. Also on the card is read well irrigated lands.</p>
<p>Watering installation immediately turn in a circle around the center, thus forming a green acreage circular configuration. Lack of cultivated farmland around Yarylgachskoy Bay and Lake. Donuzlav confirmed map "Vegetation", which in these parts - and semi-desert vegetation of salt marshes of the steppes.</p>
<p>A detailed examination of the material can be discerned most channels, the main ways; well read and relief items urban settlements (especially in the insets).</p>
<p>Different coloring water areas illustrates how the depth of the water in the direction from the coast to the center (Lake Uzunlarskoye, Tobechitskoe et al.).</p>
<p>Compare cards with any other similar size enables verify how well the chosen mathematical projection and update geographic base maps in the atlas. A considerable amount of information obtained from this material is proof that modern technology can be used effectively in monitoring the situation in many areas of research.</p>
