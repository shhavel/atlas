<p>Agroclimatic resources - is the ratio of heat, moisture, light needed to grow crops. They are defined by geographic location within the territory of climatic zones and natural areas. Agroclimatic resources characterize the three indicators:</p>
<p>The amount of active air temperature (the sum of daily average temperatures above 10 Â° C) to facilitate the rapid development of the plants.</p>
<p>The duration of the period of active temperatures (growing period) during which the temperature favorable for the growth of plants. Distinguish short and long periods sredneprodolzhitelny vegetation.</p>
<p>Provision of plant moisture (determined by the coefficient of moisture).</p>
<p>Coefficient of moisture - determined by the ratio of heat and moisture in a particular territory and is calculated as the ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration. The higher the temperature, the greater volatility and, accordingly, less dampening factor. The lower the coefficient of moisture, the drier climate.</p>
<p>Heat distribution and precipitation on earth depends on the latitudinal zonation and altitudinal zones. Therefore, according to security agroclimatic resources on Earth isolated agro-climatic zone, sub-zone and zone moisture. On the plains they have latitudinal location, and in the mountains vary with altitude. For each agro-climatic zone and sub-zone are examples of typical crops, specifying the length of their growing season. Map of "Agro-climatic resources" is complemented by "Types of winter." It will help to characterize the background and development of agriculture in the world.</p>
<p>The diversity of agro-climatic resources depends on the geographical location of the country. These resources are inexhaustible, but their quality may vary with climate change under the influence of human activities.</p>
