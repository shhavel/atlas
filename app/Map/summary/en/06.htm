<p>If traveling by land from the north pole to the south, it can be seen that large areas of the earth surface with the same nature are changing each other. This piece of land called natural areas.</p>
<p>In the natural area is like weather throughout the year, such soils, plants and animals.</p>
<p>In the northern hemisphere from north to south are such natural zones: arctic desert, tundra, taiga, mixed forests, forest-steppe, steppe, desert.</p>
<p>The mountains natural areas vary from bottom to top.</p>
<p>The territory of Ukraine is in the areas of mixed forest steppe and steppe. Ukrainian Carpathians and the Crimean Mountains consider some natural (physiographic) countries.</p>
<p>Mixed forests</p>
<p>Area of ​​mixed forest occupies the northern part of Ukraine. its surface is flat. Zone of mixed forests called Ukrainian Polesie. On the territory of this natural area many rivers. This - the land of lakes and wetlands. There, a large artificial pond - Kiev reservoir.</p>
<p>In the area of ​​mixed forests spring cool. Summers are warm and moist. In summer, the sun's rays heat the earth well, as the sun rises high in the sky. Autumn rain. Winter snow, not too cold, with thaws.</p>
<p>Owing to the large amount of rain the river flowing Polesie. In the spring, when melting snow on them are long-term flooding. Rain and melt water slowly seeps into the soil, so the formation of swamps. Groundwater outcrop numerous streams. They feed the rivers, lakes and swamps.</p>
<p>In the forests of plants grow in tiers. Form the upper tier of the tree. Average, which is called the understory - bushes. Bottom - herbaceous plants and fungi.</p>
<p>In the northern zone of mixed forests dominated by spruce pine and hardwood - oak. Further south, in addition to oak, with pine grow hornbeam, birch, linden, aspen, maple, alder. Undergrowth form blackberry bushes, rose, barberry, hazelnut, raspberry. In wetlands distributed cranberries and blueberries.</p>
<p>Early spring bloom in the woods the first snowdrops, snowdrops, Corydalis, anemone. Later - lily of the valley, violet, bush, sleep-grass. In summer, the trees are only voloholyubyvi, tinevytryvali -paporoti plants, mosses, coltsfoot. Other herbaceous plants grow in edges and edges. They include St. John's wort, yarrow, valerian, chamomile, willow herb. In mixed forests of many fungi.</p>
<p>In the fall of deciduous trees and shrubs deciduous leaves. Most herbaceous plants die. Fallen leaves and dead plants form the forest floor, which retains moisture in the soil. Perehnyvayuchy Gradually, it becomes a nutrient for plants.</p>
<p>In the area of ​​mixed forests varied fauna. Here are found herbivorous animals: bison, elk, red deer, roe deer, rabbit, mouse. Prey - a wolf, fox, lynx, polecat, pine marten. There are also omnivores - wild boar, badger, squirrel, hedgehog.</p>
<p>Near the forest ponds settle beavers, otters, muskrats. In the forest, and live on the fringe of snakes and lizards. With water connected with the life of snakes, frogs, newts. Rivers and lakes are rich in fish.</p>
<p>In the forest litter, under the bark of trees, plants live many insects. They are food for birds. Most of the birds arriving in spring of warm countries. This - the nightingales, cuckoos, starlings, flycatchers, orioles. In forested lakes and swamps appear white stork, gray crane, snipe, swans. Permanent residents of the zone of mixed forests are grouse, capercaillie, black grouse, gray owl, woodpecker great.</p>
<p>To maintain and enhance the nature of the zone of mixed forests, created Polessky, Rivne and other reserves.</p>
<p>Forest-steppe</p>
<p>Farther south of the zone of mixed forests, the more there is treeless areas - areas of steppe. The land on which alternating patches of forest and steppe, called steppe zone.</p>
<p>In the forest-steppe zone of warm summers and moderately cold winters. Rainfall is less than in the area of ​​mixed forests, but more than in the plains. In steppe areas mainly black soil. Natural conditions are favorable for the growth and development of many wild and cultivated plants. In this zone there are areas mostly deciduous forests. They live animals, most of which are common in the area of ​​mixed forests.</p>
<p>Steppe</p>
<p>South of the forest to the Black and Azov seas stretched treeless area -stepova zone of Ukraine. The surface is flat steppes, with hills, ravines and gullies.</p>
<p>In the area of ​​steppe sun is higher in the sky than in the zone of mixed forests. Because the sun's rays fall on the steppe zone straighter and harder heat the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>The steppes summer long, sunny, hot. Rainfall is scarce. Autumn is warm. In the second half of the autumn rains. Winters are short and cold, with little snow. Spring comes early. Because the temperature rises sharply, the moisture from the soil evaporates quickly.</p>
<p>In spring and summer the hot dry winds often cause drought. In winter, cold winds causing blizzard brown and black. They destroy fertile soil.</p>
<p>Steppe zone to the seas flowing large river of Ukraine. In the Danube Delta many freshwater lakes and the Black Sea coast - salt lakes, estuaries. On the Dnieper cascade built artificial reservoirs - reservoirs.</p>
<p>The steppe zone is growing herbaceous plants. Trees and shrubs are found on the banks of ponds and ravines. Only when they have enough moisture.</p>
<p>Bright and colorful desert in the early spring. When the soil has enough moisture, there rannokvituchi plants: cocks, hyacinths, crocuses, Adonis, tulips, peonies, poppies. Before the heat and allow the plants shed their seeds. their ground portion dies. In soil are tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, where they can accumulate nutrients. These substances plants grow and bloom the following spring.</p>
<p>Rannokvituchi modified plants that are adapted to the heat and lack of moisture.</p>
<p>Summer in the desert with wormwood are, fescue, feather. Some plants have long roots which take out from the depth of the water. Other - tight or narrow hairy leaves. Through them, very little water evaporates.</p>
<p>In mid-summer the heat begin to dry up all the plants. The wind picks up and rolls them into a ball in the desert, standing vytrushuyuchy seeds. At this time the plain gray and cold.</p>
<p>The steppe zone is poorer fauna than in the forest. Almost all animals became yellow-gray color, which makes them less visible among the yellowed grass.</p>
<p>Most animals live in burrows. These rodents, marmots, squirrels, hamsters, mice, jerboas. A well-developed front teeth they gnaw plants. Dig holes foxes, weasels, badgers. For animals are hiding holes during an emergency and inclement weather, the birthplace of kids. And for some of them - a place of winter sleep or hibernation, stockpiling forage. In the burrows of small animals settle reptiles, including snake steppe, steppe tortoise, lizard Warbler.</p>
<p>With its ability to run fast from the enemy fleeing rare prairie birds - bustard, little bustard. From early spring to hear the singing of a lark plains of the steppe. Submit a voice and quail. Stroll rare bird - Demoiselle crane. High in the sky flying birds, steppe eagle, Red-footed falcon, Pallid harrier, kestrel. They prey on rodents and small birds.</p>
<p>In the steppes of many insects, butterflies, beetles, locusts, grasshoppers. Food for them are different parts of plants. Insects, in turn, are food for birds, reptiles and amphibians.</p>
<p>For nature conservation in the steppe zone established reserves, including: Askaniya Nova, Luhansk, Ukrainian steppe.</p>
<p>The Carpathian Mountains</p>
<p>The Carpathian Mountains are located in Ukraine, called the Ukrainian Carpathians.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Carpathians - the mountains, the average height. They are formed by several mountain ranges. Between them lie picturesque valleys.</p>
<p>Carpathian Mountains - a place in Ukraine where most precipitation falls, rain - in the spring and summer, snow -vzymku. Spring snow lies long, rounded at the tops of mountains, but eventually melts under the sun. After the rains and snow melt water streams flowing down from the mountains into the valley, and often causes flooding.</p>
<p>From the mountains flow many streams and rivers. They originate Dniester, Prut and their major tributaries. In the Carpathians, there are small but fairly deep lake with crystal clear cold water.</p>
<p>At the foot, on mountain slopes, growing deciduous forest. His form oak, hornbeam, linden, maple, beech. Above -holodnishe because there are conifers - spruce fir and European, which is called the fires. From hardwood dominated by beech. The forest is mixed. The undergrowth of deciduous and mixed forests form the raspberry bushes, hazel, blackberry, rose hips. At the edges and clearings grow herbaceous plants, most of them medical. Under the trees a lot of mushrooms: white, boletus, aspen, boletus, mushrooms.</p>
<p>The higher the climb into the mountains, the deciduous trees less. Wood is pine. Also spruce and fir, larch grows in it. Coniferous trees holodostiykishi than deciduous. Coniferous forest is dark and moist. The ground between the trees covered with moss. At the edges of low bushes growing cranberries and blueberries.</p>
<p>In the Carpathians pine forests give way to thickets of pine and juniper. Behind them stretched mountain meadows - plains. They are covered with multicolored flowering herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>In the Carpathians inhabited by the same animals as in natural areas in the plains. These animals, red deer, hare, fox, wolf, marten, otter, wild boar, badger, squirrel. Birds - black grouse, grouse, woodpeckers colorful, bird, black and crested tit, many migratory birds singing.</p>
<p>But there are animals that are increasingly common in the Carpathians. Among animals - brown bear, wild cat, lynx, with birds - black stork, eagle, golden eagle, crossbill spruce, black woodpecker, Short-toed Eagle. Only in the Carpathian forests occur: protein Carpathian, snow vole, grouse Carpathian. Reptiles and amphibians in the mountains many species. This - the spotted salamander, newt Carpathian, snake wood, Viviparous lizard, toad and frog Warbler. In rapid mountain rivers usual fish trout. In the forest floor, in trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants living insects and their larvae.</p>
<p>To preserve the nature of the Carpathians, created reserves: Carpathian and Gorgan.</p>
<p>Crimean mountains</p>
<p>Crimean mountains bordering the zone of steppes and the Black Sea. From the sea separating their flat strip coast of varying width. Prior to the desert down sloping hillsides and the sea - steep cliffs.</p>
<p>In the mountains there are weird pillars, pyramids, bizarre rock. Many also caves and deep wells, which does not melt thick ice. All this - the result of the sun, wind and water.</p>
<p>Crimean mountains are wet, dry island in the Crimea. Winter in the mountains of heavy snowfall is common blizzard. Spring rains in the summer - storm showers. Autumn in the mountains dry and warm.</p>
<p>Mountain river flowing deep narrow gorges. During the melting of snow and rain are raging. In a little small rivers dry up.</p>
<p>In the Crimean Mountains, as in the Carpathians, plant life varies from bottom to top. The lowest on the slopes of oak forest stretches fluffy and juniper high. These include common arbutus, pistachio. In the undergrowth grows - prickly juniper, rose, daphne, dogwood, ivy. The third tier in this forest form various herbaceous plants. Spring bloom snowdrops, crocuses, hyacinths. Summer - deaf nettle, buttercup separate, fluffy cow parsnip, adenofora Crimea, which are listed as endangered.</p>
<p>High in the mountain forest appears sessile oak and pine Crimea, and in the undergrowth - jasmine, prickly thorns. Even higher - in the mountains - in a forest dominated by hornbeam and beech with pine Crimean.</p>
<p>On the flat tops of the Crimean mountains stretched mountain meadows - plateau. In jajlah no shade, little water. Because of the rain and melt water quickly runs on the slopes, and some - evaporates. In jajlah growing herbaceous plants that have adapted to arid conditions. This - feather grass, fescue, sage, chaff, awnless, sedge, thyme, sainfoin.</p>
<p>In the Crimean mountains are inhabited by different groups of animals, because there are all necessary conditions for their life.</p>
<p>On the flat slopes in deciduous forests are inhabited by deer, roe deer, and on steep slopes -hirskyy sheep - mouflon. Also found hare, marten Crimea, Crimean mountain fox, weasel, badger, wild boar, hedgehog, bats.</p>
<p>In the mountain forests are home to many birds. Among them are Crimean jay, woodpecker colorful, black tit, crossbill spruce. In the mountains of nesting birds: Bald Vulture, Black Vulture, White-tailed Eagle.</p>
<p>Reptiles and amphibians there are many kinds, but most of them - are rare. This - the leopard snake, lizard rock, Crimean gecko, green toad, turtle marsh.</p>
<p>Crimean mountains inhabited by various insects: bugs, butterflies, dragonflies, bees, cicadas. Rare is -bohomol, ground beetle Crimean, barbel Alpine.</p>
<p>To preserve the nature of the Crimean mountains Crimean created and Yalta reserves.</p>
<p>As the Oblast Crimean Mountains distinguish southern coast of Crimea -smuhu land width from 1 to 12 km between the Crimean Mountains and the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The sun's rays almost vertically incident on the Southern coast of Crimea. They bring a lot of light and heat. For example, in Yalta a year is about 210 days of sunshine.</p>
<p>Spring starts early. Summer is almost bezdoschove, long and hot. Precipitation occurs in autumn and winter. Winter is very warm, so the snow just melts.</p>
<p>The weather also affect the Crimean Mountains and the Black Sea. Mountains in all seasons protect the southern coast of Crimea from the cold north winds. In summer the sea is cooler than land. His coolness reduces summer heat. Over the summer, the sea water is well heated. In winter it gradually gives off heat, warming the air over the coast.</p>
<p>The natural conditions of the Southern coast of Crimea promote plant growth and development. There are thickets of juniper tree-oak furry, turpentine tree. Grow plants that winter does not shed leaves. So they have adapted to dry summers and warm winters. This - arbutus, ruskus, Ivy Tree.</p>
<p>Enchants with its beauty evergreens. Among them are slender cypress, gorgeous palm trees, magnolia with large fragrant flowers, the powerful Lebanese cedar and laurel. These plants grow in parks adorn cities and towns. them in this region has long been brought from many parts of the Earth.</p>
<p>The fauna of the Southern coast of Crimea. It is home to many insects, butterflies, beetles, grasshoppers, dragonflies, bees. Among them are rare: butterfly-Brazhnyk dead head, beetles - ground beetle Crimean barbel and Alpine. They are listed in the Red Book of Ukraine. Insects are food for amphibians, reptiles, birds, animals - bats.</p>
<p>Every spring in the woods and parks fly birds: Korolko, flycatchers, nightingales, blackbirds. On the shore lodge gulls, cormorants and ducks that eat fish.</p>
<p>Hunt small rodents, hares, squirrels arrive from the mountains birds: eagles, hawks, falcons, Peregrine Falcon.</p>
<p>In these places, inhabited by frogs, lizards, legless lizard in particular - Sheltopusik, snakes.</p>
<p>For preservation and conservation of the Southern coast of Crimea created reserves: Karadag Cape Martian.</p>
<p>The sun heats the Earth's surface. From her hot air. Warm air is easy. It goes up, which gradually cooled. The higher the climb up, the colder. It can be felt in the mountains. Summer at the foot of the valleys and hot, and the high tops of snow and ice.</p>
