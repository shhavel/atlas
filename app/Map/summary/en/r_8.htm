<p>Soil - a top layer of loose rocks, converted the joint action of components of inanimate and animate nature (solar heat, air, water, plants, animals, bacteria). Rocks (sand, clay, loess) play a crucial role in the formation of soil so they called the parent rock.</p>
<p>The main component of soil is humus (humus), which determines the fertility of the soil - the higher the humus, the fertile soil.</p>
<p>A variety of factors determine the soil extraordinary diversity of soils, which comprise hundreds of species. The basis of classification of soils laid difference in structure, composition, color, humus layer.</p>
<p>The most important factors include the distribution of soil heat and moisture, so each natural area correspond to certain types of soils. Thus, the most common red-yellow soil moist rainforest formed under the influence of a large amount of heat and moisture. Then they change from the equator to the generated alternating wetting provided red soils. In the deserts of gray and brown desert soils are influenced by excess heat and lack of moisture. They actually have no humus and because agriculture is possible with artificial moisture (oases) or along the river valleys, where a special intrazonal soils - alluvial river valleys. Further, under the influence of different ratio of heat and moisture, one after another, going gray forest, podzolic soils, etc. Most fertile soils on Earth is black, representing one of the greatest treasures of our country.</p>
<p>The soil can significantly change due to human activity. There are many examples where due to irresponsible human activities in the former fertile land arose career, piles, bins and more. Designed to prevent this land reclamation (restoration of disturbed land) and an integrated approach that has the most to consider all the consequences for the environment, which may cause human economic activity.</p>
