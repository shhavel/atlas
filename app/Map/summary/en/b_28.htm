<p>Engineer with energy and chemical industry is part of the so-called avant-garde three branches that ensure the development of scientific and technological progress. Modern engineering world consists of more than 200 branches. Map Oil and Gas industries represented by a separate group. So hard (general) Engineering manufactures technological equipment for other industries: mining, energy, metallurgy and so on. The general engineering also includes machine tools and agricultural machinery. These industries are oriented mainly to the consumer and areas of ferrous metallurgy.</p>
<p>Automotive, railway engineering, shipbuilding, aviation and space industry relating to transport engineering. Production of different vehicles is time-consuming, so gravitate to large cities, where there is skilled workforce.</p>
<p>Precision engineering combines instrumentation, electrical and electronics industries, which are labor-intensive and scientific. Leadership in the production of precision engineering belongs highly developed countries, and in the production of household appliances is dominated Newly industrialized Asian countries and China.</p>
<p>The high level of engineering and metal with the Group of Seven countries, Russia and most of Europe. Here the major centers of engineering. In the world there are the following major engineering areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>North America (30% of world production);</li>
<li>Western Europe (30%);</li>
<li>East and South-East Asia (20%);</li>
<li>Russia and the CIS.</li>
</ul>
