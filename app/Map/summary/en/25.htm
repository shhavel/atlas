<p>The vast majority of items used by medieval people, created handmade. Technology has evolved very slowly. Almost no changes have happened in construction machinery, all done old ways. Remained unchanged as tools for farmers. Usually all work carried out by hand, cows lacking.</p>
<p>If you look at the medieval technique, it may seem a poor and primitive. She even inferior to that enjoyed by the ancient Greeks and Romans. Yet humanity is not stopped in its technological development; changes were, albeit slowly. This was due to several factors: first, medieval artisans did not seek to increase the production of its products due to limited demand would result in price reduction and, consequently, to a reduction in income; Second, in a society that focuses on tradition, the new has caused suspicion and fear and perceived as diabolical. Therefore, we almost did not reach the few names of the inventors of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The most significant innovations that changed life in the Middle Ages were, the appearance of the stapes (borrowed from the East, the Chinese invented), which contributed to the knights; invention of the collar in the IX - X century .; massive use of mills - water (invented by the Romans in V - VI cent.) and wind (borrowed from Persia in the XI - XII century.). In the XIV century. water mill has been improved: nyzhnobiyne wheel was replaced verhnobiynym (water falling from above). Also water drive was used to propel the hammers for crushing ore, forging, pumping water from mines and so on. Since the XI century. Europe extended paper in the XIII century. almost completely replaced the parchment. It's cheaper books, contributed to the development office. Soon there were glasses (XIV c.).</p>
<p>But the production of innovative things achieved by improving old technologies or borrowed from the East.</p>
<p>The impetus for the creation of simple machines was to upgrade the first machine - a mechanical clock. There are mechanisms to facilitate the work of the person when lifting loads, and Braces, jacks, cranes, piston pumps. For laying and cleaning of canals began to use earth-moving machines.</p>
<p>Large changes in the military have made the appearance and distribution of firearms (from XIVst.). Knight's cavalry began to lose its role as the once mighty castles could not withstand the cannon fire.</p>
<p>In the case of maritime important inventions were the compass and the astrolabe, a device for determining the coordinates of the ship.</p>
