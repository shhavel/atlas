<p><b>SITUATION IN UKRAINIAN STATE AFTER DEATH Bogdan Khmelnitsky</b></p>
<p>The internal situation of the Ukrainian state after the death of Khmelnytsky mainly caused by external factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Union collapsed states against the Commonwealth.</li>
<li>Transylvania was defeated.</li>
<li>Brandenburg ruler separated from the Commonwealth and Prussia finally joined them from Brandenburg.</li>
<li>Sweden, involved in a war against of Denmark, withdrew troops from Poland and soon concluded a peace agreement with Muscovy and the Commonwealth.</li>
<li>Poland to take revenge for the humiliating defeat of the Ukrainian past years, together with the Crimean Khanate began preparations for a new war.</li>
<li>Resorted to the offensive against the independence of the Ukrainian state and the royal government. Evidence was "sex" ("items"), with the description of major new vision of the Russian throne Ukrainian-Russian relations, which they brought to the king's ambassador Chyhyryn A.S.Matvyeyev.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>1) in major Ukrainian cities have standing royal governor of the host, they should refrain from the local population;</li>
<li>2) taxes on rent, income and mills should come to the king's treasury;</li>

<li>4) continue the candidature Hetman should be reconciled with the king;</li>
<li>5) elected Metropolitan of Kiev must be sent to the dedication of the Moscow Patriarch and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reason for changing the course of the State to Ukraine in the summer of 1657 was dissatisfaction with the Moscow government that still does not have real control over the territory of the Cossack Army and the Ukrainian leadership has consistently evaded the implementation of the agreement in 1654 on the restriction of International Relations's government and tax collection the royal treasury.</p>
<p>On the domestic situation of the Ukrainian state has affected the long war.</p>
<p>The situation was complicated by a deepening of differences between supporters of different foreign policy orientations between the right bank and left bank shelves.</p>
<p><b>Getman Vyhovsky, his foreign and domestic policy</b></p>
<p><b>The election of Ivan Vigovs'kogo</b></p>
<p>During the life of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, 5-11 April 1657, officers' council has made a ruling on the transfer of power after the death of Hetman his 16-year-old son, Yuri.</p>
<p>The implementation of the decisions in life would be to introduce the continuity of the Hetman's power, that the establishment in Ukraine monarchical form of government.</p>
<p>But after the death of Hetman Khmelnitsky has changed. 23-26 August Chyhyryn officers' council was held at which the hetman to adulthood Yuras Khmelnytsky was elected secretary general John Vyhovsky.</p>
<p><b>Foreign Policy John Vyhovsky</b></p>
<p>In the foreign policy of the newly elected Hetman sought to continue the policy of Bohdan Khmelnytsky aimed at achieving full independence of the Ukrainian state and strengthen its international authority.</p>

<p>There has been finalized an agreement with Sweden. It provided for the establishment of Ukrainian-Swedish military-political alliance, which was designed to ensure the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Council also decided to renew alliances with Turkey and the Crimean Khanate, and to conclude a truce with Poland.</p>
<p>However Hetman Vyhovsky tried to avoid complications in relations with Moscow.</p>
<p>The king sent an embassy to the report on the election of a new Hetman.</p>
<p>In Moscow, the long delayed the recognition Vyhovsky Hetman, requiring him many concessions, especially the introduction to the major cities - Pereyaslav, Nizhin and Chernihiv key to Moscow led by the governor.</p>
<p>This would enable Moscow to intervene in the internal affairs of Ukraine and would limit it is not addictive. Requirement was conducting re-election with the king's representatives.</p>
<p>Vyhovsky had to accept the king's demands, hoping that the assault on Moscow stop.</p>
<p>After the February Council 1658 in Pereyaslav, which confirmed the election Vyhovsky hetman, the magistrates were allowed to come to Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>Home Politics John Vyhovsky</b></p>
<p>His domestic policies Vyhovsky John sought primarily to satisfy the interests of the elite officer and pokozachenoyi Ukrainian gentry, that acted as rulers of most Western countries.</p>
<p>Generous gifts of land holdings and privileges of those in power caused discontent poor Cossacks and peasants. Growing internal tensions benefited from Poltava colonel Martyn Pushkar, who himself sought the Hetman's mace, and Zaporozhian Ataman James Barabash.</p>
<p>With the support of Moscow, they organized a revolt, defeated at Poltava Colonel units Ivan Bohun and John Serbyn and captured the Poltava and Lubensky regiments.</p>
<p>Hetman calls for an end to the civil war were not so Vyhovsky had to take drastic measures. In May 1658 hetman's troops defeated the rebel troops at Poltava. Pushkar was killed in battle, and Barabash captured and executed.</p>
<p>After the suppression of the rebellion Moscow government openly interfere in Ukrainian affairs by providing financial support to opponents of the hetman.</p>
<p><b>Treaty of Hadiach</b></p>
<p>Duplicity Moscow, which for the sake of their own interests provoked rebellion Pushkar demonstrated desire to conquer Ukraine Moscow government.</p>
<p>It made Vyhovsky again think about finding another ally. After much hesitation, he decided to apply to the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>In the city. Gadyach September 6, 1658 between Hetman Ukraine and Poland have signed an agreement titled Hadiach.</p>
<p>Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania formed a federation of three independent states, united only in conjunction elected king.</p>
<p>Within Ukraine Kiev, Chernigov and Bratslav provinces became independent state called the Grand Duchy of Rus.</p>
<p>The highest legislative authority in the Grand Duchy of Rus belonged MPs from all lands principality, and executive - to concentrate in the hands of the hetman, who was elected for life and be approved by the King.</p>
<p>Assumed that the Grand Duchy of Rus have their own judicial and financial systems, it was about creating their own monetary.</p>
<p>Ukrainian army was consist of 30 thousand. Cossacks and 10 thousand. Auxiliaries.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical union had to cancel all three states.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Church had to have the same rights as Roman Catholic.</p>
<p>It was supposed to establish two universities, one of which received Academy status (Kyiv-Mohyla Academy), as well as colleges, high schools, different schools and printing presses.</p>
<p>Introduced complete freedom of speech and press.</p>
<p>Hadiach contract was more deliberate and precise than the contract in 1654, unfortunately, was not destined to realize, especially since Poland is not going to adhere to its terms.</p>
<p><b>Moscow-UKRAINIAN WAR 1658-1659 biennium.</b></p>
<p>The main cause of Ukrainian-Russian war 1658-1659 biennium. Was incompatible approaches Hetman and Royal Government on the further development of bilateral relations:</p>
<p>Russia, seeking to become the strongest power in eastern Europe and in the Orthodox world in general, wanted to seize the Ukraine, and Ukraine - on the contrary, sought to strengthen his own state under the protection of Moscow, but no real inclusion in the Russian government space.</p>
<p>Major events Muscovite-Ukrainian War 1658-1659 biennium. Unfolded in the spring and summer of 1659</p>
<p>At the end of March 1659 more than 100 thousand Russian army led by Prince O.Trubetskym moved to Ukraine.</p>
<p>April 20 it was stopped at Konotop who defended Chernigov Cossacks and Nijinsky Nijinsky Regiment commanded by Colonel Gregory Hulyanytskoho. Almost two months Cossacks held siege.</p>

<p>The main battle took place June 28, 1659 in the vicinity of the village. Sosnivka Konotop. It ended in a crushing defeat of the Moscow troops.</p>
<p><b>End Hetman Vyhovsky</b></p>
<p>Big victories Konotop not put an end to strife in Ukraine. Among the Ukrainian was no unity on the future of the motherland. Independent Ukraine each group understood on their own, primarily defending their own interests.</p>
<p>So as soon Konotop battle broke out a new anti-government uprising, led by Yuri Khmelnitsky was raised.</p>
<p><b>The causes of the revolt</b></p>
<p>Ordinary Cossacks and peasants supported him, fearing that with the introduction of the treatise Hadiach back national-religious oppression and serfdom.</p>
<p>Bench rebels increased and those who did not want to weaken Moscow as a possible ally in the war against Poland.</p>
<p>The rebels pryluchalysya Left Bank residents, because they frighten possible war against Muscovy, which would be deployed on their land.</p>
<p>In September 1659 at the Kyiv region Hermanivka met Cossack Council.</p>
<p>The Cossacks refused to recognize Hadiach treatise opposed the alliance with the Polish king and expressed mistrust Hetman Vyhovskyresults.</p>
<p>After the Council Vyhovsky not wanting Ukraine's new disaster that caused a civil war would renounce clubs and went to his native Volhynia, which then was ruled by the King of Poland, and was elected Hetman Yurii Khmelnytsky.</p>
