<p>After the Napoleonic wars, relations between the major powers were based on the principles established by the Congress of Vienna (1815). However, by mid-century, these principles were finally rejected. The man who began to destroy the Viennese system was Emperor Napoleon III of France (1851-1870 gg.). There was no doubt that he wants to get the glory of his famous uncle. This meant France will again seek not only great power status, but also try to be the first among them. Napoleon III was vigorously expand French influence in the world that were outright challenge England.</p>
<p>The main confrontation between two opposing unfolded in the plane of colonial conquest, which is even called "Second Hundred Years' War." Napoleon III of France continued colonial expansion that began in the 30s of the XIX century. in Indochina and North Africa (Algeria, Senegal, etc.) tried to seize Mexico. However, this did not prevent them to work together on the issue of colonization of China ("Opium War"), and in particular, to eliminate Russia as an important force of European and world politics.</p>
<p>Yet the focus of Napoleon III was Europe. He supported the liberal and national liberation movements in Europe, trying to use them as a means to strengthen the position of France. This policy was inevitably lead to a clash with the interests of Austria and Russia.</p>
<p>Main attack Napoleon III decided to strike on Russia, which was the "gendarme of Europe". This was used next Russo-Turkish War, which broke out in 1853 France, supported by England (of course with his thoughts) and Sardinian kingdom, were on the side of Turkey. This turn of events did not expect Russia. The war, known as Crimean (1853-1856 gg.), For major events unfolding there, failed to. Fighting around the perimeter of its vast territory proved she can not. The Crimean War was the first war of the XIX century., Where victory zdobuvalysya not only armies, but also economies. It won industrialized agriculture. The war showed that opens up the possibility of military affairs Industrial Revolution. The right strength was more significant for the legal rights of monarchs. This trend in political thought called "real politics", its main principle - a stronger promotion of human injustice and weaker.</p>
<p>Russia's defeat changed the balance of power in Europe. Significantly strengthened Prussia and Sardinian Kingdom, who led the struggle for the formation of national states in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, France broke the balance of power in Europe, England took care of the problems of its colonial empire. Pearl of the colonial possessions of England was India. To strengthen its borders colonialists began to seize the neighboring areas - Burma to the east and Afghanistan (First Anglo-Afghan War 1838-1842 gg.) In the west. But the main danger is not colonizers waited outside, but inside the country. In the 1857-1859 biennium. Flashed a powerful national liberation uprising sepoys, which questioned the continued rule of the British in India. Only through military superiority and cruelty colonizers managed to tame the popular movement.</p>
<p>The main concern of the British government was to ensure safe maritime connections with India.</p>
<p>The construction of the Suez Canal (1869) route to India took place around Africa. The English in this way created a number of strong points, the most important of which was the Cape Colony in southern Africa.</p>
<p>Here they had to face with the descendants of Dutch settlers - the Boers. Unwilling to accept the authority of England, in the 1836-1844 biennium. They came out of the British possessions and headed north. In the heart of the continent, between Orange and Limpopo rivers, they conquered the local tribes and created two Boer republics, the Transvaal and Orange Free State.</p>
<p>Chain bases England also established in the Mediterranean and Red seas, through which later prolih shortest route from Europe to India, Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Suez Canal, Aden.</p>
<p>England was an important acquisition Singapore, located in the Malacca Strait, which connects the Indian and Pacific Oceans.</p>
<p>The feature of the colonial policy of England was that it had a colony founded by European settlers, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Cape Colony. In the middle of the XIX century. British government gave the residents of these colonies self-government rights. Colonies were called dominions.</p>
<p>Another important direction of British policy was the fight against the slave trade, which was banned in 1845 Thus, in Africa, Australia, the Pacific and Indian oceans European colonizers confronted mostly tribes who were still on dogosudarstvennom rannegosudarstvennogo or the level of development, the China and Japan they had to face a powerful state. However, the military superiority enabled Europeans first force rulers to "open" their state, and then proceed to attempt to colonize those territories.</p>
<p>So the 40-60-ies of the XIX century. became fateful for the future of the world.</p>
