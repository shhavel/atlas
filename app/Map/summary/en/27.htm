<p>Contamination of the environment has a long history. Even the inhabitants of ancient Greece and ancient Rome have expressed concern about contamination of the territories in which they lived. In the Middle Ages, the first law on environmental protection.</p>
<p>Actively change the nature of man leads to an imbalance in the flow of natural processes in the geographical envelope. This in turn gives rise to global environmental problems. Among the most dangerous scope problems such as the greenhouse effect (constant warming) and increase in sea level; air pollution and the associated acid rain; ocean pollution and the reduction of its resources; desertification; ozone depletion and so on.</p>
<p>Contamination of the water shell is the result of discharge into rivers, lakes and seas agricultural and industrial waste. The most polluted rivers are the Rhine, Danube, Seine, Thames, Dnieper, Volga, Tiber, Nile, Ґanh. Among the most polluted seas are internal and marginal. Mediterranean, for example, is one of the key areas of world shipping: it is simultaneously up to 10 thousand. Ships are transported annually to 400 million tons of oil. Because of this, in the 60-70 years of the twentieth century. marine pollution has reached a critical level. Later it was a series of environmental measures somewhat improved the situation.</p>
<p>The water area of ​​the oceans most affected by oil pollution and disposal in waters of radioactive and toxic waste.</p>
<p>Air pollution is a result of industry and transport, which annually emit billions of tons of solid and gaseous particles of various harmful compounds. Most of the problem affects large cities, but acid rain falling outside the cities, causing significant damage to crop, destroying life in fresh water, forests and other vegetation.</p>
<p>In addition, serious harm "green lungs of the planet" and has an uncontrolled industrial deforestation. The consequence is a decrease of oxygen in air, soil erosion, desertification territories.</p>
<p>The major danger to humanity are man-made disasters. Accidents at nuclear power plants, chemical plants, oil tankers can have serious consequences: loss of life, changes in the surrounding landscape, the removal of economic circulation of large territories. Sad example is the accident at Chernobyl.</p>
