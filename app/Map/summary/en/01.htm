<p>Among the questions posed in front of the primitive man, obviously, there were questions about the properties of the natural environment. Curiosity gave rise to the desire to know what is around these hills, the forest and the river. The world that opens a person to appear in her mind, and knowledge are essential to survival, handed down from generation to generation. Over time, people began to sketch, but with the advent of writing and recording what they saw and heard, learned schematically depict terrain. It gradually accumulating knowledge about the Earth. Where ended information included fantasy.</p>
<p>At different times and in different peoples of the planet were very different and much different from today. Thus, the ancient Indians believed that the Earth - a hemisphere, which hold four elephants standing on a giant turtle. Residents of Ocean coast imagined the Earth as a disc placed on the backs of three whales that swim boundless ocean. In the mind of the ancient Chinese Earth took the form of a giant cake. At one time the Egyptians believed that the sun travels the sky on a ship that supports the goddess of the sky, and the Babylonians depicted the Earth as a mountain, surrounded by the sea.</p>
<p>However, the accumulation of knowledge about the world, people began to wonder why the ship gradually disappearing over the horizon, the horizon itself expands when climbing up, while a lunar eclipse the Earth's shadow becomes round. These and other observations were systematized by Pythagoras of Samos Ancient Greek scientists (VI cent. BC) and Aristotle (c. 384-322 BC.), Who first suggested the spherical shape of the Earth. Pythagoras substantiated his opinion thus: everything in nature must be harmonious and perfect; perfect with solids is bullet; The land also has to be perfect, so she - spherical! In the third century. BC famous Greek mathematician and geographer Eratosthenes Kirenskyy (c. 275-194 years. BC) first obrahuvav size of our planet, introduced the concept of "parallel" and "meridians." Also for the first time, albeit arbitrarily, he put those lines on his map enclosed inhabited earth. This card used the nearly 400 years - the end of the first century. To have survived 27 maps of the ancient Greek scientist Claudius Ptolemy (c. 90-160 AD.) From the Egyptian city of Alexandria, which he added to his scientific work "Geography". In this work he described as a sign cards, numbered about 8 thousand. Names of various objects in an area including several hundreds of geographic coordinates specified under the sun and stars. Ptolemy first used a grid of meridians and parallels, which is not much different from today.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, when the church denied the sphericity of the Earth, the time between scientists of antiquity were forgotten, and the land depicted as a circle or a rectangle in the center often housed holy places in the far east - the heaven and the west - hell. In the VI. one of the maps created Byzantine monk Cosmas Indikoplov. Depicted his system of the world, despite the obvious absurdity, then spread to Europe. Even in the XIII century. English world map, placed in the Psalms, the "center of the world" posted Jerusalem - a holy place for Christians.</p>
<p>Geographical globe as the layout of the world, created the first German geographer Martin Behaim in 1492 African coast was applied on the basis of evidence of the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias, who in 1487 first in Europe rounded Africa to the south, opening the Cape of Good Hope. Information on the globe was severely distorted, where actually supposed to be America, depicted the east coast of Asia, and many non-existent islands. After all, Europeans have not been aware of the existence of America, although that year when Behaym created a globe expedition of Christopher Columbus reached the shores of the New World.</p>
<p>It took a long time until, through the efforts of brave explorers and travelers, with maps disappeared "white spots". Even in the nineteenth century. remained little known giant space around the north and south poles of the planet.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is understandable why the map hemispheres of satin Gerard Mercator, published in 1606, in place of Antarctica shows "Unknown Land", and North America extends up to the North Pole.</p>
