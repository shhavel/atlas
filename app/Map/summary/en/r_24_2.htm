<p>Climate</p>
<p>Geographical location of the continent causes the inflow during the year a significant amount of solar radiation and the presence of high temperature almost everywhere. A predominance of tropical continental masses and descending air movements makes this the driest continent.</p>
<p>Most of the continent lies in latitudes where the prevailing trade wind circulation. Pacific air masses do not bring significant rainfall in the interior of the continent: the Great Dividing Range intercepts the moisture trade winds and abundant rainfall so only on the windward slopes and narrow coastal strip. Thus, almost 40% of the continent receives less than 250 mm of rain per year and only 10% - more than 1000 mm per year.</p>
<p>Australia is located in three climatic zones: sub-equatorial, tropical and subtropical.</p>
<p>In the northern part, which is in subekvatorialnomu belt, characterized by high (about + 25 ° C) temperature throughout the year and a large (about 1500 mm) rainfall that is unevenly distributed throughout the year. Summers are very humid with storm rains, and winter is dry.</p>
<p>In the tropical climate zone with generally high temperatures (summer + 30 ° C, winter + 16 ° C) are distinguished by moistening two types of climate: continental tropical rainfall of 200 mm per year and the high amplitude temperature and tropical humid (up to 2000 mm of rain per year).</p>
<p>Subtropical zone of the southern part of the continent is characterized by positive temperature throughout the year with a significant difference in rainfall western and eastern parts of the belt. Thus, the south-western part of Australia is located in the Mediterranean-type climate with dry summers and wet winters. The central part of the belt - the area of ​​the continental subtropical climate with dry hot summers and relatively cold winters. In the southeast -volohyy subtropical type of climate with uniform precipitation throughout the year.</p>
<p>Natural areas</p>
<p>The largest area of ​​tropical semi-desert and desert represented Victoria and Great Sandy Desert, in coastal areas pass into the semi.</p>
<p>Characteristic of these places is red surface, caused by a high content of iron compounds in the sand.</p>
<p>Having pretty much like the desert, flora is explained by close of groundwater. Single shrubs of acacia and eucalyptus trees in some places passing into impenetrable thickets, and along the river, sometimes there are groves of eucalyptus goals. Of the animals here live ostriches emus, kangaroos, lizards and poisonous snakes.</p>
<p>Area of ​​wet evergreen rain forest on red-yellow soils feralitni - a narrow strip in the east of the continent. The warm climate and adequate moisture is causing the development of diverse vegetation: eucalyptus, araucaria, different types of palms, ferns, bamboo. Many here and fauna; and some of the inhabitants of these places generally are endemic (marsupial flying squirrel, koala, echidna, paradise bird).</p>
<p>In the extreme south-west - an area tverdolystyh evergreen forests and shrubs. In eastern subtropical zone - the zone of mixed forests on red-yellow soils with palms and evergreen beech.</p>
<p>For the area of ​​savannas and woodlands, occupying large areas of the north and east of Australia, is characterized by different types of eucalyptus, acacia, bottle tree growing on red and brown soils. Kangaroo, platypus, ostrich emu, wombat - representatives of the local fauna.</p>
