It laid the foundation for the principle of separation of powers into executive and judicial branches, implemented elected positions. These features document shrewdly anticipated future directions of development of democratic states.</p>
<p><b>CREATING Orlik coalition antymoskovskoyi</b></p>
<p>Activities Philip Orlik Hetman post was aimed at creating antymoskovskoyi coalition.</p>
<p>May 10, 1710 approved the election of Charles XII Orlik hetman.</p>
<p>On the same day, signed the new agreement between Ukraine and Sweden. It potverdzhuvalysya guarantee the independence and autonomy of Ukraine. Sweden undertook to provide defense and territorial integrity.</p>
<p><b>Hike Orlik Right Bank Ukraine in 1711</b></p>
<p>During the year Orlik managed to create anti-Moscow coalition of Sweden and the Crimean Khanate, Turkey, the government Orlik, as well as those of the Polish forces that supported Stanislaw Leszczynski. Allies had a plan military campaigns on the Right Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>January 31, 1711 detachments of Cossacks led by Kostya Gordienko under the leadership of Philip Orlik went from Bender.</p>
<p>Along the way they were joined by Polish and Tatar troops. Allied troops quickly proceeded to the Right Bank.</p>
<p>Ukrainian population of joy greeted Orlik, passed without a fight town. The Right Bank shelves, except Bilotserkivskyi acknowledged Orlik for Hetman and went to his side.</p>
<p>Statements against Moscow administration began in Left-Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>Left Bank Hetman Ivan Skoropadskyi sent against Orlik shelves, but they were defeated.</p>
<p>In late March, the troops came under Orlik White Church, the strongest fortress on the right bank, and surrounded her, but soon due to the lack of heavy guns needed for the attack, were forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Determined the fate of the campaign and the approach of the Moscow army and treacherous action has long been uncertain Tatar allies. In late April, Orlik and Cossacks had to return to Bandar.</p>
<p>According to the plan of joint actions against Moscow in late January 1711 with Khan 50,000th horde left the Crimea and moved along the lower Dnieper, and then returned to Kharkiv.</p>
<p>Almost meeting no resistance, Tatars captured Slobozhanshchina However, going to Kharkov, Horde suddenly retreated and returned to Crimea.</p>
<p>Instead of liberation Horde campaign has once again brought to the Ukrainian land robbery, fire; thousands of Ukrainian captured.</p>
<p><b>Prut campaign of Peter I</b></p>
<p>In the spring of 1711 began the Moscow counteroffensive. Tsar Peter I declared war on Turkey.</p>
<p>Moscow army went through Ukrainian territory to Moldavia.</p>
<p>Entered the territory of the Right-Bank Ukraine, the king's army on the orders of Peter the destroyed towns and villages, tortured the local people, tens of thousands were driven in Left Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>In June 1711 the main forces of Moscow's troops that they had led Peter, together with detachments ally - Moldavian master - came to Iasi.</p>
<p>In early July, came to the area Falchi Turkish-Tatar army. On July 8-9, the decisive battle.</p>
<p>Army of Peter I was surrounded, she threatened the entire lesion.</p>
<p>But Moscow Command settled case: faint Turkish army chief was a large bribe and agreed to negotiate.</p>
<p><b>Prut Peace Treaty in 1711 and its implications for Ukraine</b></p>
<p>Negotiations between Muscovy and Turkey resulted in the conclusion of a peace treaty. It was signed on 12 July 1711 at pp. Rod near Iasi.</p>
<p>By agreement of the Moscow government undertook to convey Turkey of Ukrainian lands, including the Azov with the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Moscow promised to destroy their newly built fortress - Taganrog, Stone backwater on the Dnieper, Novobohorodytsku fortress in the estuary. Samara (now within Dnipropetrovsk).</p>
<p>In addition, the Moscow government has the obligation not to interfere in Polish affairs, denied Zaporozhye and Right-Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>As for the Left Bank, the article about it was formulated so ambiguous that each side could interpret it differently.</p>
<p>Over the Prut Peace Treaty of Turkey in Moscow to allow the army to withdraw its troops from the artillery and wagon train from Moldova.</p>
<p>Prut Peace was not profitable for Moscow. Having emerged from the entourage, Peter violated the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>It made Orlik take steps to persuade the Turkish government not to approve contractual documents as long as Moscow does not fulfill all obligations and do not give up all of Ukraine. However, the Turks under the pressure of Britain and the Netherlands have ratified the treaty.</p>
<p>However, when ratifying the Prut Peace Treaty in Istanbul Turkish government forced Peter the urgent obligation to fulfill Azov and Taganrog, and begin the withdrawal of troops from Poland and those land-bank Ukraine, which belonged to Poland under the contract in 1686</p>
<p>March 5, 1712 issued a firman (decree) of Sultan, followed by the Right-Bank Ukraine and Sich distributed power Orlik.</p>
<p>Next month, Turkey signed an agreement with Moscow: Left bank of Kyiv and its suburbs remained for Muscovy.</p>
<p>Ratification of the treaty Prut in this form became heavy blow to Orlik and his associates. After all, Ukraine has remained divided over the Left Bank continued to dominate Moscow.</p>
<p>Authorities are on the right-bank Ukraine Orlik received by the sultan's firman, because of the intransigence of Poland was too elusive, two years later, in April 1714, between Turkey and Poland have signed an agreement under which the right-bank Ukraine remained in Poland.</p>
<p>So hope Philip Orlik the rapid liberation of Ukraine failed. He himself remained Hetman in exile, because no patronage of the Swedish king, no alliance with Crimea, or the recognition of the owner of the Right-Bank Ukraine from Turkey or Host support troops not vtoruvaly his way to Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>ATTEMPTS TO CREATE ORLYK coalition antymoskovskoyi</b></p>
<p>In June 1714 Orlik had to leave the bender to Western Europe.</p>
<p>At the invitation of Karl XII and Philip Orlik part of the officers moved to Sweden.</p>
<p>In 1720 he moved to Germany and later to France.</p>
<p>From 1722 to move to Turkey, where he spent the last 20 years.</p>
<p>And no matter where the Orlik, he never once forgot about the main goal of the activity, which saw the creation antymoskovskoyi coalition. Hetman believed that only with the help of other countries can liberate Ukraine from the yoke of empire and unite all Ukrainian lands into a strong state.</p>
<p>Seeking the support of European countries such as England, France, the German states, Poland, Sweden, he sent many letters zverennya governments, breaking them Ukrainian question.</p>
<p>Philip Orlik lost no opportunity to touch the subject of Ukraine, or in direct contact with Charles XII, King Louis XIV, Augustus II, Stanislaw Leszczynski, Sultan and khans, or meeting with key ministers most influential states.</p>
