<p>In the German command had the impression that winning the East and provided a take on opponents in the west. February 21, 1916, German troops on the part of the front length of 40 km attacked. His fierce shelling. Unseen force target was the fortress of Verdun. Well fortified, it was the edge of the French defense. Under the German plan, the risk of losing this key position will force the French to throw all their forces here. But as soon as the German infantry was raised in the attack, it is facing higher furious fire. After a few months of bloody fighting, the Germans were able to delve into the French defense only 7 km. Break through the front or even seize Verdun they failed.</p>
<p>The forces of both sides were exhausted by the day. In the midst of the Battle of Verdun command of the German troops were transferred to the winners of the Russian Field Marshal von Hindenburg and P. General E.Lyudendorfu. New command recognized bleak future attack on Verdun, "Verdun was an open wound, which saps our strength ...".</p>
<p>France expected to help Russia and England. Indeed, June 4 Russian army under General Alexander Brussiloff after a brief but powerful artillery barrage broke through the Austro-German front in four places at once. The success of the offensive was achieved thanks to tactics, the Russians struck not in the same place as it did before, but at the same time in a few that made it impossible to charge the enemy troops to repel the attack. Suitable attack the Russians reoccupied most of Galicia and Bukovina. The total loss of the Austro-German troops formed the 1.5 million soldiers, of whom about 400 thousand. Captured. The Russians captured 500 guns and a lot of other weapons, while losing three times less personnel (includes 62 thousand. Dead). The German command hastily removed the troops in the west and threw them to the east. The success prompted the Russians to join the war on the side of the Entente Romania (August 16, 1916). However, the Romanian troops were quickly defeated, and the country was occupied by the enemy. The Russians had to deliver a new ally that would extend the front line for another 500 km (in the East along with West and South-West also formed Romanian Front).</p>
<p>July 1, 1916 the French and British troops launched an offensive on the Somme River. Barrage of artillery fire, which lasted seven days, destroyed the German wire fences, trenches, passages connections. In front of each meter Anglo-French artillery vyverhnula about a ton of metal. Besides the infantry, the first breakthrough came tanks (15 September 1916). Success tank attack was impressive, the Anglo-French vyska plunged into the enemy defenses on the 5km with minimal losses. Previously, such a breakthrough achieved at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. However, German forces kept the pressure and autumn active hostilities on the River Somme stopped. In December ended without result and Battle of Verdun.</p>
<p>Results of the military campaigns in 1916 in the West were stunning. Verdun killed up to 1 million German and French soldiers and officers. On the River Somme, both sides have lost more than 1.3 million soldiers.</p>
<p>These terribly victims not identified the winner. The war continued. Constantly improved deadly weapons and equipment. For destroying people used artillery, tanks, air force, chemical weapons. The level of technical equipment of the Anglo-French forces ahead of Germany. War opponents rack, requiring the mobilization of the last human, material and food resources. The most catastrophic situation after the battles of 1916 happened in Germany, whose army was reduced to 1 million soldiers, whom they had not been replaced.</p>
<p>On the eve of the war Germany has paid considerable attention to the establishment of large surface fleet, which would be able to defeat the main maritime powers of England. But from the beginning of the war the German fleet was unable to counter the naval blockade as determined by the Entente. The actions of the German Navy were limited to the Baltic Sea, and the Austro-Hungarian - Adriatic. Only a small force of German fleet caught with the beginning of the war in the spaces of the world's oceans caused some worries allies. Thus, in the Black Sea under the Turkish flag German cruisers "Geben" and "Breslau" fired Odessa, Sevastopol, Theodosia and Novorossiysk. In the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were German raiders who tried to disrupt maritime transport between the countries of the Entente. But at the end of 1914 after the defeat of the German squadron in the South Atlantic near the Falkland Islands States Triple Alliance were in the final naval blockade.</p>
<p>Began the search for new effective means of naval warfare. Saving ubachavsya to deploy submarine warfare. Significant efficiency submarines are shown in 1914. Thus, the German submarine boat «U-9" with impunity in one attack off the coast of the Netherlands was sent to the bottom of just three British cruisers.</p>
<p>In February 1915 Germany declared all the waters surrounding the UK combat zone and directing here its submarines. May 7 the object of attack was the British passenger liner "Luzytaniya" with 1198 passengers on board, of whom 124 were Americans. Death "Luzytaniyi" has become one of the largest maritime disasters. United States issued a strong protest because, in addition to casualties, a submarine war harmed the American commerce. Avoiding conflict with the US, Germany temporarily restricted submarine warfare. The German command gave the order not to sink passenger ships without warning. In practice, the submarine commander this order is often not performed.</p>
<p>In May and June 1916 between the British and German fleets held the largest naval battle in the war. It both sides attended the main forces of the fleet. The German command took a breakthrough naval blockade. The clash with the English fleet occurred in the North Sea off the coast of Jutland. German fleet attempted to cut the British fleet to split it in parts, but she was almost cut off from their bases and hurriedly left the battle. During the battle anliytsi lost 14 ships, the Germans - 11.Povernuvshys on base over the German fleet at sea did not appear.</p>
<p>In Germany, the newly invigorated proponents of unrestricted submarine warfare. "We will drown even chips if it floats in England" - they supported Kaiser Wilhelm II. Entente countries suffered from German submarines (the bottom was sent to more than 2000 vehicles). To call Germany the Allies responded deploying shipbuilding, development of effective means of combating submarines. Aggression Germany outraged world opinion. The loss of American vessels, especially US citizens are increasingly tuned the US public against Germany. It became clear that submarine warfare can not decide the fate of war, which was becoming protracted.</p>
<p>In 1915 the warring parties had difficulties supplying armies. Largest Dyfitsyt weapons, because of the weakness of the economy, felt Russia. To broaden the scope of military production was introduced strict government regulation of the economy. The state determines the amount of required production placed the order, provided the raw materials and labor. Labor conscription was introduced, which enabled us to reduce the shortage of manpower caused by the conscription of nearly all adult men in the army. Because wartime production grew by civil, there was a shortage of consumer goods, which forced introduce price controls, rationing consumption. Mobilization of harm to agriculture. In all the belligerent countries except England, the production of food products decreased, which led to the introduction of rationing of food distribution. In Germany, traditionally imported food through the blockade had a very difficult position. The government there had to ban feeding cattle corn and potatoes, introduced a variety of substitute products - ersatz. The system of state control over production and consumption has become the most rigid form in Germany.</p>
<p>Living belligerent countries radically changed. His level dropped everywhere. In Germany in 1917 filling grocery cards do not satisfy the physiological needs - famine (winter 1916/1917 biennium.), The victims of which was about half a million people. The difficulties of the war led to the great mortality among the civilian population. Along with combat deaths it caused population decline of Austria-Hungary, Germany and France.</p>
<p>Severe consequences of the war most strongly manifested in. The economic and social problems was added the political crisis caused by lesions at the front, distrust of the government and its inability to end the war. Precarious position of power, the Bolsheviks rocked hard, using hunger and devastation in the country for their own purposes. In February 1917 anti-war and social performances in Russia gained unprecedented momentum and has grown into a revolution. Save monarchy failed. In early March, power was transferred to the Provisional Government. Russia became a republic (announced September 1, 1917). The new government has not released from the obligations of Tsar Nicholas II, the Allies and, despite the protests, called to continue the war until victory.</p>
<p>In 1917 the German High Command preferred defensive tactics Entente - offensive. In December 1916, Germany has proposed to begin peace negotiations, hoping to retain all the conquered territory. Entente countries rejected this proposal. There was an agreement of staff allied armies of simultaneous offensive in 1917 in all European fronts.</p>
<p>But the revolution in foiled attack Russian troops. Under the influence of revolutionary events in Russia mass strikes swept in England, France and Italy. Strikers and protesters demanding the termination of the war. With revolutionary sentiments spread to Russia and in Germany. In April and May on the Eastern Front experienced mass fraternization soldiers of the German army and the Russians. Prospects of withdrawal from the war extremely alarmed allies, but Germany added hopes of winning.</p>
<p>In the further course of the war had a decisive influence US position, the only great power that has not been drawn into the war.</p>
<p>United States of America was a country that did not wanted to defeat the Entente. For a long time it was unprofitable to enter the war - because the US supplied the Entente countries weapons, ammunition, food, and with the states of the Austro-German bloc trade through neutral countries. In 1914 the US debt European countries, mainly England, was about $ 6 billion. During the war they not only paid off the debts, but turned from the debtor to the creditor European countries (loans totaled more than 10 billion dollars). Possible to defeat the Entente could make difficult the return of these huge funds. Also, the ruling circles of the United States wanted the country to play a more important role in international politics, not taking part in the war, could not claim a share in postwar redistribution of the world.</p>
<p>Once it became known as Non-Allied unfolding events in Russia, 3rd February 1917 the United States severed diplomatic relations with Germany and declared war on April 6. Entering the war, the US did not zv`yazuvaty some kind of commitment, hoping to war play a key role during the peace talks as a referee. The formal pretext for war was the German diplomatic cables ("Zimmerman Note"), the English intelligence intercepted and handed over to the Americans, which was about secret negotiations in Germany and Mexico for an alliance against the United States. During the year, the Western Front has attracted over 2 million American soldiers. American industry has received new orders. For the purposes of the Army and Navy allocated substantial funds. Economic, military, financial power of the United States was directed against Germany and has not left her chances of winning.</p>
<p>General Entente offensive on all fronts at the same time in the spring of 1917 was unsuccessful. In April, a joint Anglo-French command attempted to attack the enemy near Reims. Seven weeks of heavy fighting brought no success. The French lost in killed and wounded more than 500 thousand. Soldiers. In the French army mutinies broke out against the continuing senseless war. The new commander of the French troops Peten (Hero Defense Verdun) violent actions and some more comfortable staying soldiers at the front managed to bring order to the troops. Meanwhile, in the next six months later the entire burden of fighting fell on the shoulders of the British. They were able to spend several successful acquisitions that strengthened undermined the spirit of the troops of the Entente. One of these operations in the vicinity of Cambrai (November-December 1917) was a "triumph of the tanks." Here, 378 British tanks in conjunction with infantry and aircraft attacked and broke through the enemy defenses sylnoukriplenu. However, the success, the British could not, but the tanks finally proved its military value.</p>
<p>To the east in July 1917, Russian troops launched an offensive in the direction of Lviv. And it cost them a new defeat and huge losses. German troops launched a counteroffensive. They finally drove the Russians from Galicia and captured Riga.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bad luck befell the Italians suffered a crushing defeat at Caporetto in October 1917, although it had numerical superiority. Italian soldiers retreated in disarray. 300 thous. Of them were captured, 130 thousand. Died. Just moved from Nice cars British and French divisions somewhat fixed position and prevented the exit of Italy from the war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Russia, as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution November 7 (October 25) in 1917, quickly changed the political course. Having seized power, the Bolsheviks December 15 concluded with the Austro-German command truce. Previously, it has made Romania. February 9, 1918 Ukrainian National Republic made peace with the Quadruple block. 3rd March 1918 between Germany and Soviet Russia signed a separate Brest-Litovsk. As a result, peace Germany gained control over a large territory (Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, the Baltic States, Finland, the Caucasus). In government circles in Germany are beginning to mature plans for a mighty empire that brings in Central, Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>The German troops were moved west to gain final victory over the British and French before arriving at the front of American troops. From late March to early June, the Germans carried out at least three offensive operations ("Battle of the Kaiser" or "Operation Michael"). They had some advantages, but lacked adequate assessment of the enemy. By applying new tactics breakout defensive lines by assault teams armed with grenades, light machine guns, mortars, sacrificing the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, they crossed the river Marne and close to Paris. Here the Marne again the fate of the Western Front. The capital of France fired from long-range guns bombarded using aircraft. And it did not change the overall situation. Human Resources Germany exhausted. Desperate around the soldiers reluctantly obeyed the orders of commanders. July 18 allies marched on the offensive and pushed the Germans from the Marne and not lose the initiative.</p>
<p>Final blow to the German troops allies have put near Amiens on August 8, where British tanks broke through the German defense. In one day, was defeated 16 German divisions. The commander of the German Army Field Marshal von Hindenburg told Kaiser Wilhelm II on the feasibility of the peace, while troops are on enemy territory.</p>
<p>Without waiting Steps Germany, under pressure from the Entente forces capitulated on September 29 Bulgaria. A month later invited the world Austria-Hungary and Turkey.</p>
<p>Austro-Hungarian Empire was torn by internal contradictions. National liberation movements grew in the democratic and national revolution. On creation of the Czecho-Slovak Republic declared Czech Republic and Slovakia. Joint independent state of South Slavs decided to create Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In Galicia was proclaimed an independent West Ukrainian National Republic. In early November, separated from Austria and Hungary. Austro-Hungarian monarchy collapsed. On November 3rd, the command of the Austro-Hungarian Army signed an armistice with the Entente.</p>
<p>The internal situation in Germany has long been uncertain. Growing mass protests against government policies. In April 1917 at a munitions factory in Germany went on strike more than 300 thousand. Workers. In August, riots broke out among the sailors of the navy. After the release of the war morale of the German army is not increased, and pidupav. Go west and die, continuing to effectively lost war no one wanted. In Germany, the brewing revolution.</p>
<p>Assessing zahrozlyvist situation, the German High Command issued an ultimatum put the request to the emperor to stop the war and prevent the explosion of the revolution. The German government appealed to the US president's request for an armistice and peace. Wilson agreed to start negotiations on condition of diversion of German troops from the territories of classes and the abdication of the Kaiser.</p>
<p>While in Berlin speculated, in Kiel November 3 rebelled Navy. They were outraged by the attempt to command throw them in the final battle. To protect their interests sailors created the first German council. In Berlin the fight up workers.</p>
<p>November 6, US President said that Marshal Foch authorized to take command of the German. The next day, the German delegation led by Minister Ertsberґerom under a white flag crossed enemy lines. Then she arrived at the railway station Rethondes Komp'yenskomu in the woods, where there was a staff car of Marshal Foch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile revolutionary wave continued unabated, and November 9, Germany was declared a republic. Chancellor Max Baden announced the abdication of the Kaiser. Power passed to a Social Democrat Ebert. Negotiations were Komp'yenskomu forest on behalf of the new government. Ultimate humiliating for the German delegates form the Allies put a number of conditions. Within two weeks the Germans had to evacuate troops from Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Alsace and Lotarynґiyi. They had to cancel the Brest-Litovsk treaty, arms transfer all the winners, to set the captives home. However, allied commanders agreed to temporarily leave the German forces in the Ukraine and the Baltic States to prevent the establishment of Bolshevik control over them. The term truce was 36 days.</p>
<p>At dawn on November 11, 1918 between Germany and its opponents Second Armistice at Compiègne was signed. At 11 am there was a signal "Cease fire!". The First World War ended.</p>
<p>More than four years - from August 1, 1914 to November 11, 1918 The First World War lasted. It involved 38 states with over 1 billion people. In battles killed 10 million, 20 million were wounded or maimed. Losses amounted to one-third of the national wealth of the parties to the war. In calculating the material cost it 80 billion.</p>
<p>One outcome of the war was a new balance of power in the international arena. United States began to act as a lender of European countries, according strengthened their role in world politics. The world entered the new shape. During the war political system of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Russia could not stand the test. Empire of the Hohenzollern, Habsburg, Romanov, Ottoman collapsed. On their ruins, new state. Increased influence of Japan. Shaken the colonial system.</p>
