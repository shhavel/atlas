<p><b>Germany XVII - XVIII</b></p>
<p>After the Thirty Years War, the Peace of Westphalia (1648) permanently secured fragmentation of Germany. Most German states and possessions belonged to the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Elected emperor of the dynasty of the Austrian Habsburgs College of Electors 9 - powerful German princes. However, the real power of the emperor extended only to the birth of the Habsburg possessions.</p>
<p>The largest states of the empire were Austria, Brandenburg - Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria. But a leading role in the future development of Germany and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe played only the first two of them.</p>
<p>Austrian Habsburgs, who were the Holy Roman Emperor, had lands that were outside the Empire and were inhabited by other peoples. All the possessions of the Habsburgs became the basis for the formation of the Austrian Empire. The impetus for the emergence of Austria, as a multinational state was Turkish aggression. The country has become the barrier that the Turks could not overcome.</p>
<p>Overcoming the Turkish threat Austrian Habsburgs faced the problem of maintaining and strengthening its growing holdings.</p>
<p>The most acute problem emerged during the reign of Emperor Charles IV, who had no male heir. Anticipating the precariousness of the state after his death, he succeeded to the neighboring rulers recognized his daughter Maria Theresa ruler of the Habsburg Monarchy (Pragmatic Sanction).</p>
<p>But get the crown Maria Theresa immediately became involved in the struggle against the pretenders to the throne (War of the Austrian Succession 1740-1746 gg.) Despite the difficult situation, she was able to protect his right. In subsequent years, Austria has actively participated in the wars that were fought on the continent. Maria Theresa founded in his domain reform in the spirit of enlightened absolutism: strengthen the central authority, conducted military reform, to regulate relations between peasants and landowners, streamlined legislation. Implement measures for the development of education. The main purpose of these reforms was to strengthen the authority of the emperor, combining possessions, the unification of economic, political and social life of the empire.</p>
<p>Significantly more reforms achieved son of Maria Theresa, Joseph II. He resorted to a further strengthening of the central government and unification possessions. Subordinate the church. Continued codification of laws. Canceled the peasants' personal dependence. Continued development of education. In the reforms he guided little realities that led to considerable resistance to his reform activities. At the end of the reign of most of his reforms was canceled.</p>
<p>If the main objective was to preserve the Habsburg their possessions, the rulers of Prussia was mostly their multiplication. From the middle of the XVII century. begins a rapid rise of Brandenburg-Prussia. In 1657 Prussia emerged from under the Polish burns. Elector Frederick I proclaimed himself king. This event, subsequently gave rise to the Prussian king to expand their holdings to their sizes were worthy of the royal title. To implement these plans had to be a large army and funds for its maintenance. Through a variety of activities, austerity Prussia received a small army, numbering not yield large European states, and by fighting qualities was considered the best.</p>
<p>Implicit measures such military power allowed from the famous Prussian King Frederick the AI ​​to start an active foreign policy, which has become the main method of warfare.</p>
<p>Barely set foot on the throne of the young king (Frederick AI was then 28 years old) immediately started a war with Austria, the main rival for supremacy in Germany. In this war (1740-1748 biennium) Prussia Austria robbed the rich province of Silesia. Raging Maria Theresa was able to form the anti-Prussian coalition of France and Russia. However, on the side of Prussia unexpectedly gave England.</p>
<p>The war began, which was called the Seven Years (1756-1763 AD), which became the third pan-European. In a sense it can be compared with the wars in XX .: Besides Europe were fighting in North America and India. Seven Years War fundamentally changed the balance of power in Europe: former sworn enemies became allies (France and Austria), sharply increased military power of Russia.</p>
<p>Russian troops have launched a series of heavy defeats "invincible" Prussian army, and even entered Berlin. But the death of the Empress Elizabeth had saved Prussia from the final defeat.</p>
<p>As a result of the Seven Years War in Europe, the borders remained unchanged. Prussia almost a century had to abandon the plans of German unification under his headship.</p>
<p>However, England won the war only. There was a crisis in its rivalry with France. She captured the French possessions in India and North America. England became the leading trading and colonial power in the world.</p>
<p>Although Frederick II was defeated in the struggle for supremacy in Germany, he did not leave hope to expand their holdings. And the chance came when Prussia, Austria and Russia agreed on the division of Poland (the first section 1772). Subsequently, Prussia as a result of the second (1793) and third (1795) divisions attached to his possessions nearly half of ethnic Polish lands.</p>
