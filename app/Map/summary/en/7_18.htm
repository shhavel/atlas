<p>Under the pressure of adverse circumstances, Daniel had to take Burundai demands the destruction of the city fortifications, Vladimir, Lutsk and several other cities. Only Capital Hill preserved fortification.</p>
<p><b>2. Successor Daniel Galician</b></p>
<p>The death of Prince Daniel (1264), his kingdom was divided. Although Vasylko Romanovich, Danilov brother and poshanovuvaly as "father and mistress," his power extended only to Volhynia from the capital city Vladimir.</p>
<p>Galician, Przemysl and Belz principality retained the eldest son of Daniel Romanovich - Lev.</p>
<p>Eastern Volyn Lutsk received from Mstislav Danilovich.</p>
<p>KHolmskim Principality departed youngest Danilovich - Shvarnu.</p>
<p><b>Vladimir Vasylkovych</b></p>
<p>When Cornflower R. died, his son inherited the land of Vladimir.</p>
<p>It belongs to the most prominent figures in our history. With his name researchers link a second, Volyn, of Galicia-Volyn chronicle.</p>
<p>The chronicler tells about Vladimir Vasylkovych as an outstanding scribe and philosopher.</p>
<p><b>Leo D.</b></p>
<p>As for the children Danilov, the most active among them was Prince Lev.</p>
<p>He intends to combine their homeland under one arm.</p>
<p>By their possessions Leo joined Lublin land of Transcarpathia from Mukachevo.</p>
<p>The death Shvarna he took KHolmskim principality, and in 1272 moved his capital to the city.</p>
<p>Intended to occupy the throne of Lithuania, but could not implement them.</p>
<p>In foreign policy, Leo D. sought closely with Poland.</p>
<p>Large well maintained diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic and the Teutonic Order.</p>
<p>In relations with the Horde Leo has somewhat changed the tactics of his father: he did not resist the Mongols, and regard the presence of their will.</p>
<p>In particular, he had, even against their own interests, to go to war with Poland and Lithuania.</p>
<p>However, despite this concession, Leo nevertheless failed to secure peace in the country, used for Horde Galicia-Volhynia as a base for their attacks on neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Were not successful and honest solicitation Lion Volyn lands that were the legacy of Vladimir Vasylkovych because despite all his request Volhynia was transferred Mstislav Danilovich.</p>
<p>The latter died without heirs, and the land of the kingdom of Daniel Romanovich yet been merged - grandson of Daniel and L. George.</p>
<p><b>3. Board and George L.</b></p>
<p>Board George L. (1301-1308 gg.) Is defined as the heyday of the state, its peace and economic prosperity.</p>
<p>Evidence might and George was that he, like Daniel Romanovich, took the title "King of Russia".</p>
<p>This title has witnessed his seal, where he is depicted sitting on a throne wearing a crown on his head and with a scepter in his hand.</p>
<p>Some historians believe that the crown and Yuri could get in exchange for recognition of the supremacy of the Pope, taking the union of church and with the promise of a crusade against the Horde.</p>
<p>Others emphasize that the coronation could not be, and King George and named as winner of the state - on the European tradition.</p>
<p>On the plausibility of this view shows subtle religious policy of the King of. It is known, in particular, by George I in 1303 with the consent of the Patriarch of Constantinople was established separate Ukrainian Orthodox Metropolis - Galician.</p>
<p><b>4. Last princes. The decline of the Galicia-Volyn state</b></p>
<p>Heritage and George went to his sons - Andrew and Leo II, who ruled together.</p>
<p>They called themselves "princes of All", thus expressing the claim to continuity of Nation traditions of Kievan Rus.</p>
<p>Lead direction of foreign policy of the Andrew and Leo a focus on alliance with the Teutonic Order and Poland.</p>
<p>Thus princes tried to weaken its dependence on the Horde in the battle against which they may have died.</p>
<p>Since none of the brothers had no children, then their deaths in 1323 Romanovich dynasty in the male line was interrupted.</p>
<p>Almost two years Galician-Volyn throne remained vacant, although there was no lack of applicants.</p>
<p>Year 1325 Galician-Volyn nobles elected head of state Prince Boleslaw, son of Mary, the sister of the last rulers of Andrew and Lev II, who took the name of orthodoxy and George.</p>
<p>The intention to restore power during the Galicia-Volyn principality evidenced by the fact that documents George II called himself "the prince of God's grace and Didych Kingdom of Rus 'or' innate grace of God, Prince of all of Ruthenia" and used the royal seal of George I.</p>
<p>Boleslav Yuri II ruled from 1325 to 1340</p>
<p>In foreign policy, he held an alliance with the Teutonic Order, finding in this way as opposed to Poland, relations which were hostile.</p>
<p>George II forged friendly relations with Lithuania, enhancing their marriage with the daughter of Prince Gedimin.</p>
<p>However, the happy reign of George II Boleslaw not.</p>
<p>After all, he had to lay his head against the conspirators, in 1340 he was poisoned.</p>
<p>According to sources, this happened to George II Boleslaw due to complications religious situation.</p>
<p>From childhood Catholic, he "became rozmnozhaty number of Latins and their faith," "prynadzhuvav from around the edges of Catholic priests and theologians, wishing to vaccinate their faith in Rusyn."</p>
<p>Death of George II Boleslaw had to Galicia-Volyn principality negative consequences.</p>
<p>His death took advantage of the west, who wanted to increase their territory at the expense of Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>Galicia-Volyn prince was recognized Liubard son of Lithuanian Prince Gedimin whose wife came from a family of Galician-Volyn prince and so he had a legal right to the Galician-Volyn heritage.</p>
<p>However, their power Liubard extended only to the territory of Volyn.</p>
<p>In 1349 the Polish king Casimir campaign launched longstanding war of Galicia-Volyn region.</p>
<p>It ended that Galicia from Belz land and Holm was ruled by the Kingdom of Poland, Volhynia - under the authority of the Lithuanian dynasty.</p>
