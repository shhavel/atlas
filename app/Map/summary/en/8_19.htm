<p><b>The policy of the Moscow government in Zaporizhzhya Sich</b></p>
<p>The imperial government always treated to Sich biased, seeing in it an ominous fire dissent and freedom.</p>
<p>That is why Moscow has sought to conquer in January to make the most of its military and economic capabilities.</p>
<p>The first event in the implementation of insidious intent was hosted at Host Moscow garrison, which appeared in Chortomlyk Host 1663</p>
<p>The reason for its location was declared the joint struggle against the Turkish-Tatar invaders.</p>
<p>Muscovites were instructed to work together with the Cossacks against the Crimean and Nogai hordes.</p>
<p>In garrison was assigned as the organization of intelligence: gathering information about the internal situation of the Crimean Khanate and the Nogai hordes of their foreign policy plans and the events that took place in Poland, Turkey and others.</p>

<p>According to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>commander of the garrison was obliged to follow all the events that took place in Zaporozhye;</li>
<li>had to report to Moscow on relations with the hetman of the Zaporozhian Sich, individual officers Hetmanate groups;</li>
<li>report all diplomatic relations Sich.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the terms of the truce Andrusovo dual Polish-Muscovite control of Zaporozhye 1667 royal garrisons were withdrawn from Host.</p>

<p>After a gradual restriction of civil rights in Ukraine, the desire of the tsarist government to extend its authority to all Ukrainian lands could not affect the Sich - the core of Ukrainian statehood.</p>
