<p>Cereals are the most common of all, grown person plants. When they employ about half of machining land (arable land). Purpose of cereals varied. First of all, they are used as food for the population and raw materials as feed for livestock.</p>
<p>On this map are the most common grain cereals, bread called humanity wheat (gives more than 30% corn), rice (about 28%), corn (25%).</p>
<p>Crops of wheat are concentrated mainly in the temperate and subtropical zones of the northern hemisphere, where sufficient amount of heat and moisture. The crops are mainly winter and spring wheat. Winter wheat yield is significantly higher than the spring as the spring gets a lot of moisture from melting snow and a longer growing season. Winter wheat is grown more often than spring, but in the cold winter without snow, it often freezes, causing the need to re-sow spring spring varieties. The biggest wheat producers are on the map. The major grain exporters in the world market are USA, Canada, France, Australia, Argentina, South Africa. Great potential in supplying the world wheat market is Ukraine. With wheat producing high-quality flours, cereals, pasta and confectionery, starch, alcohol.</p>
<p>Rice is the main food crop for nearly half of humanity. It is the culture of the tropical and subtropical zone with a long and warm summers. It is grown mainly in irrigated (flooded) lands in Asia, Latin America and Africa. In most countries receive two crops a year, so a much smaller area than under wheat, rice harvested almost the same amount. The biggest development in rice growing has become Asia (9/10 world production). Among the major rice producers are China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Japan, Thailand.</p>
<p>Corn (maize) is traditionally a high place in the grain balance in the hemisphere, which is his homeland, culture has gained considerable popularity in the south of Europe, China and South Africa. Produced from corn flour, cereals, starch, oil, glucose, alcohol and so on. It is widely used as a fodder crop (grain and green mass). Around half of the cultivation and export of maize falls on the United States. A lot of corn is grown in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and China.</p>
<p>Livestock - a branch of agriculture that provides people with food, supplies a variety of raw materials for light and food industries, live draft power and so on. Sector is closely linked to the crop, so the correct combination thereof is paramount in the development of agricultural production in general.</p>
<p>In animal are two ways of development: intensive and extensive. With the dramatic increase in the development of animal products obtained by increasing the productivity of animals (breeding work) in the stall or pasture farmyard animal welfare and sustainable high-quality fodder base (mostly concentrated feed). This breeding is highly developed in countries with small livestock receive the maximum amount of high quality products. This is especially true of Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, USA, Australia, New Zealand. About half of the world production of meat and milk account for highly developed countries.</p>
<p>In most cases the extensive nature of livestock is in developing countries, where the increase in livestock production is achieved through a growth stock. Such conduct sector-dominated pasture grazing system for cattle and animals rather poor performance.</p>
<p>The main components of livestock include: cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, verblyudyarstvo, horse, reindeer. On this map presents information on major livestock industries, information on other partially represented on the map Agriculture.</p>
<p>Breeding cattle represented in growing cattle, buffalo, yaks. Depending on the structure of the herd, fodder, cattle production output can have milk, meat, dairy and meat or meat and dairy. Most productive dairy cattle breeding in Europe and North America. For exports of dairy products are leaders in Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand and Australia. Meat trend prevails in areas with arid climate and large areas of grassland. The world's largest area of ​​beef cattle is a South American steppes - Pampa. Argentina called meat shop in the world, because of its central role in the export of beef. Most cattle is India, but about 60% of cows there not in use, while others are used primarily as draft animals. This is due to persistent religious traditions that promote vegetarian nutrition and cow considered sacred animals.</p>
<p>Pig developed mainly in densely populated areas of the world, as well as in the areas of production of grain and potatoes - the basis of forage base area. Half of the total number of pigs accounted for by Asia (except Muslim, where the consumption of pork is forbidden by religion). Among the world leader in the number of farmed pigs is China. A large number of pigs are also grown in the United States and Russia. Ukraine this indicator is part of the dominant dozens of countries.</p>
<p>Sheep common almost everywhere based on natural pastures in arid (dry steppes and semi-deserts) and mountain areas. In sheep, depending on the raw materials obtained from animals entails the following areas: fine-wool and wool, karakulnyy, meat, fat, sheepskin-skin coat, meat, wool and milk. Wool exporting country: Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, Uruguay.</p>
