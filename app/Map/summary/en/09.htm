<p>A complex of four paleogeographic maps of the distribution of land and sea in different geological periods reflects the most interesting phases of the ancient history of the Earth. Then it formed the main tectonic structures, but did not stop the movement of the earth's crust, continued raising and lowering of the earth's surface. As a result, certain areas of flooded land or raised from the seabed along with the sediments that settled to the bottom for long periods of geological time.</p>
<p>Comparison of these maps with map geological structure helps to understand the conditions under which delayed the powerful coal deposits, than in the Dnieper-Donets basin is thicker marine Cretaceous sediments, overlain by Paleogene and Neogene sands, and the northwest of the overlap there, why in the Black Sea 'families in so many deposits of limestone (it was a warm shallow sea, where many settled shell fossils of animals).</p>
