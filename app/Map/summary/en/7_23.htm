<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. The internal situation of Galicia-Volyn principality after the death of George II Boleslaw</b></p>
<p><b>Invitation to the Galician-Volyn table Lithuanian Grand Duke of Westminster</b></p>
<p>After the death of Prince George Boleslaw II 1340 internal situation of Galicia-Volyn principality significantly deteriorated.</p>
<p>In the absence of heirs of the princely family The local chief nobles began to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>The choice fell on the Lithuanian Grand Duke of Westminster Hedyminovychiv, who had a wife from the family of Galicia-Volyn prince and how he felt, had legal rights to the land.</p>
<p>Historians estimate the reign of Westminster in Galician-Volyn territories as a period of recovery state.</p>
<p>However, their power Liubard could extend only to Volhynia, which was then virtually independent.</p>
<p>What to Galicia, the power Liubart it was only formal.</p>
<p>The real ruler of the land was in the Galician boyar Dmitri Dedko.</p>
<p>He ruled in Galicia during the 1340-1344 biennium. Duke of Westminster behalf. This situation intends to change the Polish king, trying to connect the Galician land to its holdings.</p>
<p><b>Fight for the Galicia-Volyn land between the Lithuanian and Polish rulers</b></p>
<p>Claims Polish kingdom on earth Galicia were not new. Thus, the Polish King Casimir III, was attacked in 1340 in Lviv and just received news of the death of Prince George.</p>
<p>The real war for land in Galicia broke in 1349</p>
<p>Then the King of Poland, with the support of his cousin - the Hungarian king Lajos (Ludwig) organized a big march on the Galicia-Volyn land, seized the main city, except Lutsk, annexed Galicia and Volhynia to part of the Polish state.</p>
<p>Such developments seriously troubled Duke of Westminster, and he went to war against Casimir.</p>
<p>War of the Galicia-Volyn land was fought with varying success. Thus, in 1352, the Polish and Hungarian king led the army to Belz, but failed to take it and had to make peace.</p>
<p>Next year Liubard Hedyminovychiv his vassals and allies continued their war took Galich and went to Poland. Later again forced out of Westminster Poles in Volhynia.</p>
<p>In 1366, during another war, Belz withstood the siege of the Polish army, but the war consisted of Westminster to fail, he was forced to leave the Galician land, he lost a significant part of Vladimir and Volyn.</p>
<p>In 1370 he died Casimir III, King of Poland and became the Hungarian King Louis.</p>
<p>Ukrainian territory, their vidvoyovuvav of Westminster in Kazimierz, were ruled by Hungary.</p>
<p>First, the land ruled by a Hungarian officer, and from 1372 r.- relative Hungarian king, Władysław Opole Silesian prince, who called himself "master of the Russian land, and everlasting Didych autocrat" and minted their own money.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Liubard not prepare weapons and in 1370 regained Vladimir. In late 1376 - early 1377 an army led by Lubart Hedyminovychiv reached almost to Cracow. In early summer, Opole Władysław had to flee to Hungary.</p>
<p>In response, Louis gathered a large army and marched Volhynia, surrounding Belz. After 7 weeks in the autumn of 1377, Belz land was annexed to the possessions of Władysław of Opole.</p>
<p><b>So, long war ended with Galicia from Belz land and Holm was ruled by puppet King of Hungary, Volyn - under the authority of the Lithuanian dynasty.</b></p>
<p><b>2. Entry Kyiv, Chernihiv-Sivershchyna, skirts of the Lithuanian State</b></p>
<p>The only real force capable of opposing the promotion of Lithuania in the Ukrainian lands was the Golden Horde. However, control of the underlying land by the Mongol khans continued to have rigidity, given the gigantic sizes of felt like the Horde and the internecine fighting that more acutely flashed in the Mongolian state.</p>
<p>The majority of Ukrainian lands were annexed to Lithuania at the time of sopravleniya princes, brothers and Olґerda Keystuta Hedyminovychiv.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Lithuanian princes in Kyiv region, Chernihiv-Sivershchyna tail and some Contemporary sources associated with the battle between the Horde and the Lithuanian wives for Blue Water which occurred in 1362 (now the river cyanosis, left tributary of the Dnieper).</p>
<p>Joining lands of South-West turned Duchy of Lithuania the great feudal state. By the end of the 14th century. it was a federation of lands, principalities, including Ukrainian - Kyiv, Chernihiv-Seversky, Volhynia, Podolsk. Each of them, as before, princes ruled, however, is no longer with the Rus Rurik dynasty, and from Lithuanian - Hedyminovychiv. Kyiv and Chernihiv-Siver owners, in particular, were the sons of Grand Prince - Vladimir and Dmitry, Korbut Olgerdovich. In Volyn prince's younger brother Olґerda Liubard, and after him - of Westminster son Theodore, the tail ruled nephews Olґerda - Princes Koriatovich. The new rulers quickly turned into Ukrainian princes Lithuanian dynasty.</p>
<p><b>3. Features of the socio-political life of Ukrainian lands in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the second half of the 14th century.</b></p>
<p>The majority of Ukrainian lands during the second half of the 14th century. became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</p>
<p>Galicia was a part of the Polish kingdom.</p>
<p>That is why historians call this period the Lithuanian-Polish era.</p>
<p>If the remains of Ukrainian Galician nobles lost their power, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Rus princes and nobles kept their governing law.</p>
<p>Given the significant Belarusian and Ukrainian - Russians, as they said, terrain and conditions of their stay under the authority of Grand Dukes of Lithuania, the then State of Lithuania called Lithuanian-Russian state.</p>
<p><b>Being Russian lands in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was characterized by several features.</b></p>
<p>Rusychi accounted for 90% of the population. Their culture has had a significant impact on the Lithuanians.</p>
<p>Widespread among the Lithuanian nobility acquired Rus belief - so at first called on Lithuania Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p>Russian language became the language of the court and grand public office.</p>
<p>That is why the Lithuanian Ruthenian population is not perceived as someone else's.</p>
<p>Fixing Russian influence contributed to the marriage of Lithuanian princes of Rus' princess.</p>
<p>But the salient characteristics of being Russian lands in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was that Lithuanians allowed local Ukrainian nobles hold the highest administrative positions.</p>
<p>The Rus princes and nobles were at the service of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, in that they are fixed their ancestral land.</p>
<p>On the ground, remained all previous control system. Preserving the traditional way was carried out by the principle: "Old is not violated, and do not introduce new".</p>
<p>By the end of the 14th century. our lands continued to be large and small separate principalities, which are embodied saving state traditions and the existence of public entities in our land.</p>
<p>This continued until the Lithuanian government has not changed its political orientation.</p>
<p>The change was the conclusion Lithuanian union (union) with Poland.</p>
<p>In the 15th - early 16th century. Grand Duchy of Lithuania was gone "Lithuanian-Russian" and was "Polish-Lithuanian".</p>
<p><b>Principality of Kiev Vladimir Olgerdovich</b></p>
<p>From 1363 reigned in Kiev Vladimir Olgerdovich.</p>
<p>Mother baptized in the Orthodox rite, brought the Slavic customs and traditions, the Lithuanian prince was not perceived as a foreigner in Kiev and easily get along with the local nobility.</p>
<p>He organized several expeditions to the south against the nomadic hordes.</p>
<p>As a result of successful military operations Horde were relegated to the Black and Azov Seas.</p>
<p>This helped to lift the fallen at the time of the Mongol evil Kyiv region.</p>
<p>The expression of economic power and the desire to free depending on Vladimir was chasing its own coins.</p>
<p>Kyiv prince felt an independent ruler. This is confirmed by the sound of his title, in the few documents that have survived from that time, Vladimir Olgerdovich called himself "With the grace of God Prince of Kiev."</p>
<p><b>4. KREVO Union</b></p>
<p>Changes in the position of Ukrainian lands in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania occurred with the advent of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila Olgerdovich that its policies began to consider more than Poland.</p>
<p>Establishment of the new ruler of Lithuania took place under difficult circumstances, because inherited Jagiello Grand Vilna table contrary to the principles of tribal seniority, he was the youngest son Olґerda.</p>
<p>An uncertain situation forced Jagiello actively seek allies within the state. Following the tradition sopravleniya, he surrounded himself with his brother Skyrhayla.</p>
<p>Soon the Poles offered to Jagiello marry their queen Yadvyhoyu and, accordingly, the Polish crown.</p>
<p>The reason for such zealous solicitations on the part of Poland was a threat to both countries on the part of the Teutonic Order.</p>
<p>Jogaila accepted the offer.</p>
<p>The result of it was the conclusion of an agreement between Lithuania and Poland in August 1385 in the city. Kreva (now the territory of Belarus) public-political alliance, known in history as Krevsk Union.</p>
<p>Agreement between the Polish and Lithuanian princes powers assumed conversion to Catholicism Jagiello, his family and all unbaptized Lithuanians marriage of Jadwiga and Jagiello Grand Duchy of Lithuania's accession to the Polish state.</p>
<p>In February 1386 Jogaila accepted Catholicism, taking the name Władysław, married Jadwiga became King of Poland.</p>
<p>Soon to Catholicism were gathered and Lithuania. Lithuanian boyars Catholics were par the rights of Poles. Although complete agreement concluded in Kreva and forever connect all their land, Lithuanian and Ruthenian to the Polish Crown Jagiello and failed, for in the face of Vytautas Keystutovycha found an ardent supporter of the Rebirth of Lithuania.</p>
<p>It was launched Ostrivskoyu agreement in 1392 under which Jagiello had to recognize Vytautas life governor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, won his power of feudal princes.</p>
<p>Vytautas declared himself a vassal of the Polish king.</p>
<p><b>5. Galician and Volyn region after Krevsk Union</b></p>
<p>With the death of Westminster Volyn acknowledged supremacy of Lithuania.</p>
<p>After 1382 no longer exist and the Polish-Hungarian union.</p>
<p>Lost the support of the governor of Galicia and Vladislav Opole.</p>
<p>Polish-Lithuanian army, which came in the Galician land in February 1387, almost no resistance.</p>
<p>Przemysl and Lviv surrendered without a fight. Galician townspeople defended, but when their warlord guarantee his tenure, he also passed the town.</p>
<p>Galician land became part of Poland.</p>
<p>It was then completed the conquest Kholmian and Belz principality.</p>
<p>By 1434, these lands have remained autonomous possessions, managed by Polish officials - mayor, judges and magistrates.</p>
<p>However, about 1434 Rus province was formed as part of Lviv, Galician, Przemysl, Chelm Syanotskoyi and land.</p>
<p>Immediately after joining Galicia to Poland, the Polish government undertook opolyachuvaty Ukrainian forcibly enforce Catholicism: closing existing ones, forbidden to build new Orthodox churches and monasteries; Orthodox forbidden to occupy high positions; fostered contempt for the Ruthenian Orthodox faith and culture.</p>
