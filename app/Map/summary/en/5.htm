<p>The failure of the Bolsheviks in late October by armed force to seize power in Ukraine has forced them to change their tactics. The Bolsheviks took the course to eliminate the UCR by her re-election at the National Congress of Soviets. 4 (17) in December 1917 merged the executive committee of the Kyiv Soviet of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies announced the convocation of the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. In Congress invited representatives of provincial, city and district Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies. Of representation have been designed so that most delegates were from councils who were influenced by the Bolsheviks. At this time, as opposed to the Bolsheviks, UCR preparing elections to the Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal, equal suffrage by secret ballot and the principle of proportional representation.</p>
<p>Using the methods of political struggle for power, the Bolsheviks did not forget about the military. In Kiev, established the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), which is preparing a new uprising. People's Commissars of Ukraine unlawfully declared in a state of siege and ordered local revolutionary garrisons (55 spare revolutionary regiments) to act decisively against the enemies of the revolution, that is against UCR.</p>
<p>In response to the actions of the General Secretariat of People's Commissars ordered separate Ukrainian units that were outside Ukraine, to return home, and November 30 (December 12) in 1917 and sent to disarm the Bolsheviks of Kyiv. Failure over the attempt by the Bolsheviks seize Kyiv 2nd Army Corps, which was under their control. In the winery building forces intercepted the 1st Ukrainian Corps General Skoropadskyi, disarmed and expelled from Ukraine.</p>
<p>UCR First All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets ignored in Kiev, but this week it changed its position by sending to place a letter of request to send to Congress as many delegates from the peasants and ukrainian troops.</p>
<p>At a congress in Kyiv gathered more than 2 thousand. Delegates, including the Bolsheviks were only about 100 delegates clearly expressed support UCR.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks decided to continue working in Kharkov. They teamed up with delegates of the regional congress of Soviets of Donbass and Rih and proclaimed the beginning of the first All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. It represented only 82 Council. Delegates from the peasantry, which was almost 2/3 of the population of Ukraine, almost was not.</p>
<p>First All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in Kharkov worked 11 - 12 (24 - 25) December 1917 .; majority vote, he called for the establishment of Soviet power and Ukraine declared a republic of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies (Soviet UPR). Congress completed its work on the election of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) consisting of 41 persons (including 35 - Bolsheviks). CEC Chairman elected Ukrainian Social Democrat E. Medvedev. The CEC approved the first Soviet government in Ukraine - People's Secretariat. It consists S. Baku, E. Bosch, V. Zatonsky, J. Kotsyubynsky, F. Sergeev (Artem), M. Skrypnyck et al.</p>
<p>National Secretariat immediately lifted the ban on the export of grain to Russia and issued a ruling on the invalidity of all resolutions of the General Secretariat. People also asked the Secretariat of People's Commissars Russia for military help in the fight against UCR.</p>
<p>Along with the "war decrees" armed struggle unfolding. More December 17, 1917 Sovnarkom UCR sent an ultimatum signed by Lenin and Trotsky.</p>
<p>It was noted that in the case of non-compliance ultimatum deems Central Council of People's Commissars in a state of open war against the Soviets in Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>December 20, 1917 UCR rejected the ultimatum. Bolshevik leaders immediately declared war on the Central Council.</p>
<p>Available in two power centers Ukraine - Kiev and Kharkiv National Soviet - Russia allowed SNK formally remain aloof events in Ukraine, presenting them as an internal conflict between the Soviets of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies and UCR. Was preparing to open warfare.</p>
<p>Soviet troops were concentrated in Kharkiv, near Gomel and Bryansk under. Top leadership has Antonov-Ovseyenko, and military - former tsarist colonel M. Vorobyev. Bolshevik forces, which amounted to 160 thousand. Soldiers, consisted of the regular Army, Red Army units from Russia and Ukraine, detachments of sailors. Their tactic was to promote rail lines and establishing control of large industrial and transport center. Council expected to help the working groups in these cities.</p>
<p>Military Forces units were UCR Free Cossacks - Voluntary formation, which were created during the war. In terms of the UPR is not inferior to the Soviets, but were scattered throughout Ukraine, while Bolshevik forces acting on key strategic areas.</p>
<p>Soviet command first control over the Kharkiv and Katerynoslav province. By mid-December 1917 was captured important railway stations - Lozova Pavlograd Sinelnikovo. December 26, 1917 in Katerynoslav fallen power UCR. By the end of December were ousted from Donbass White troops of General Kaledina. In the second week of January 1918, Soviet power was established in Nikolayev, Odessa, Kherson.</p>
<p>Agreed blows from the north and east of the Bolsheviks launched an offensive in Kyiv. Superiority in number and armament, acting decisively and brutally, pens Muravyova rapidly moving to the capital of Ukraine. UCR situation became critical. Under demoralizovanosti dezorhanizovanosti regular units of the UPR symbol of national honor feat kilkohsot Kiev students and school students, led by Captain Omelchenko that 16 (29) January 1918 near the station abruptly entered into an unequal battle with the superior forces of the enemy and died in Ukraine.</p>
<p>January 16, 1918 in the capital began armed by separate parts of the city garrison and the workers of the plant "Arsenal", directed against UCR. January 22 troops under the command of the UPR Petlyury and Y.Konovalets crushed the uprising in Kiev. However, this is not little strategic value. On the same day it was released Fourth Universal that proclaimed the independence of Ukraine.</p>
<p>But the Bolshevik troops continued. January 25 members of the Small Council and the Council of Ministers left Kyiv, Zhytomyr moved to first, and then - a gazelle. Now save the UCR from the final defeat of the Bolsheviks could only help countries Quadruple Alliance.</p>
<p>January 26, 1918, Soviet troops entered in Kyiv.</p>
<p>Reasons UCR defeated troops should be considered: the weakening of social support UCR (slowness and hesitancy in implementing social and economic reforms pushed the peasantry, while the majority of workers supported the Bolsheviks); lack of focus on military policy of armed security state that was in the absence of the regular army and centralized high degree of organization and efficiency of the Bolshevik army, the successful tactics of the struggle for power; skillful social demagogy councils.</p>
<p>The first coming of the Bolsheviks to power in Ukraine was accompanied by a massive "red terror". Only in Kiev, Soviet troops under the command Muravyova destroyed to 5 thousand. People. This, of course, attracted the people of Ukraine to the new government. There were other unpopular measures Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>Central Council, realizing that her own efforts fail to overcome the Bolshevik aggression, decided to seek assistance from Germany and Austria-Hungary, which at that time led peace talks. They agreed to help in exchange for Ukrainian food and raw materials. Brest agreement was signed (February 1918), reinforcing that agreement. In addition, there was a secret agreement under which the Ukrainian living in Austria-Hungary, will be merged into a single "crown land".</p>
<p>After the agreement half a million army of Germany and Austria-Hungary moved to Ukraine. The Bolsheviks did oppose such a force could quickly retreat to, destroying them all that they could pick up.</p>
<p>Ukrainian and allies quickly showed its true face. Expelled the Bolsheviks, they were treated as invaders: arbitrarily bereaved people food, spoiled restoring order that existed before the king. All this helped to strengthen the authority of the Central Council, which in the eyes of the people looked like his treacherous interest. Meanwhile, the Germans wanted to replace the UCR for a more compliant government. April 29, 1918, with the assistance of German troops in Kiev was carried out a coup. Central Council removed from power, and the governor proclaimed hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadskiy, a descendant of the former Ivan Skoropadskiy.</p>
