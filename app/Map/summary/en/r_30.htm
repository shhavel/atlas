<p>Area of ​​North America, along with the islands - 24 250 thousand. Km square. The continent is in the northern hemisphere relative to the equator in the western hemisphere relative to the zero meridian.</p>
<p>North America is washed by three oceans: the east - the Atlantic in the west - the Pacific, from the north - the Arctic.</p>
<p>Construction of the Panama Canal was not easy sea passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Now through this channel carried an intense maritime traffic.</p>
<p>The height of the continent above sea level - 720 m, maximum - 6194 m (H. McKinley in Alaska), the lowest - 86 m below sea level (Death Valley).</p>
<p>The surface of North America has a general slope from the west (from the Cordillera), east to the Atlantic coast. South-east of the mainland take Prymeksykanska, Atlantic seaboard and Missisipska lowland formed on the Palaeozoic platform. North of Missisipskoyi lowlands lying central plain (formed in Precambrian platform), and from them to the north - Laurentian plateau, which corresponds to the performance of the crystalline basement surface - the Canadian shield. And central plains, and Laurentian Upland defined small height - from 200 to 500 m. To the east of the low plains rise the ancient Appalachian Mountains that were formed during hertsynskoyi folding. To the west of the Central Plains and the Laurentian Upland surface gradually rises, moving to the Great Plains in height from 500 to 1000 m and above.</p>
<p>From the west, the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains bordered, formed during the Mesozoic folding. Along Rocky Mountains along the Pacific coast stretches a huge mountain range - the Cordilleras. North of them formed during the Mesozoic folding, with Alpine folding undergone uplift and became a mighty mountain system of the newly alpine mountains. Further to the south as part of the Mexican Plateau extends (alpine formation), is gradually reduced to the Panama isthmus.</p>
<p>Since Cordillera - a young mountains, they still have an active seismic zone and volcanism.</p>
<p>The islands adjacent to the extreme north of the continent, covered with eternal ice (Ellesmere Island, Greenland, Baffin Island). North American glaciers by area second only glacier in Antarctica.</p>
<p>Along the coasts, attributable to tropical latitudes, extending coral reefs. Most of them are on the shelves of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>In North America, wetlands are areas - swamps in the basins of Nelson and Albany, Upper Mississippi River, near the Great Lakes and Winnipeg, the Atlantic seaboard lowlands and on the peninsulas of Florida, Yucatan. There is a dry area, especially in the Great Plains and the Great Basin, where water skontsetrovani in the Great Salt Lake.</p>
<p>In narrow bays on the north-east of the continent show the highest tides in the world - 18 meters (Bay of Fundy). The largest river in North America Mississippi River is the third longest river in the world.</p>
