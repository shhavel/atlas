<p>Oil and gas industry - components of the fuel industry in the world. The petroleum industry includes the production, transportation and refining. Distribution of world oil production presents a pie chart. The main suppliers of oil to the world market are developing countries. Over 40% of production and 50% of exports come from OPEC - Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, bringing together 12 countries in Asia, Africa and South America. OPEC established in 1960 to conduct a coherent policy on the oil market in the interests of the participating countries. Much of the oil production and exports account for the countries that are not part of OPEC (Russia, Norway, UK).

 The main consumers of oil are developed countries, as well as China and India. They are concentrated powerful refineries.

 Therefore, the major oil traffic flows are directed from the Middle East to Western Europe, Japan, China and North America. In some developing countries are creating their own refining capacity (Gulf countries, Venezuela), and it increases the proportion of finished petroleum products in their exports.</p>
<p>Gas industry provides the production, transportation, storage and processing of natural gas. Gas transport within continents occurs mainly pipelines (80%) and long distances (eg, from the Middle East to Japan), the gas is transported in liquefied form by special courts. This method of transportation leads to a noticeable increase in the cost of gas, so much of it is consumed in the countries that produce gas.</p>
<p>The major exporters of natural gas are Russia, Canada, Norway and Algeria, Indonesia, Turkmenistan. The main importers are the countries most countries in Europe, USA, Japan.</p>
