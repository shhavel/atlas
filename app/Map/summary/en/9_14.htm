<p>Economic development of Ukrainian lands in the late nineteenth - early twentieth century.</p>
<p>Reforms 60-70 years of the nineteenth century. accelerated economic development Dnieper Ukraine.</p>
<p>Began intensive development of industrial production. In the end
<br>60s and especially in the early 70s began development of Donbass. In 1871, Englishman John Hughes opened in the province Ekaterinoslavskoy Ironworks, near which there was a settlement Yuzivka (now Donetsk). From 1861 to 1900, coal production in the Donets Basin has increased almost 100 times. In the Donbas in 1900 over 2/3 of all-extracted coal. It focused almost all production of coke. In 1881 foreign-based corporation that has begun to develop iron ore mine at Saksagansky in the Krivoy Rog Basin. At the end of the XIX century. Kryvbasin gave 57.2% iron ore in the Russian Empire. In the second half of the 80 years at the Krivoy Rog ore and coking coal Donbas began construction of large steel plants in the Dnieper Basin: in Alexandria (now Zaporizhia), Katerynoslav (Dnepropetrovsk), p. Kamenskoe (DAZ). At the end of the XIX century. Ukraine became a dissertation in primary coal and metallurgical base of Russia.</p>
<p>On the Right Bank and Left Bank continued to grow sugar, food and light industry. In the early 80s, due to the increased introduction of steam power, Ukraine's sugar industry has made great development. Sugar production in Ukraine for the period from 1861 to 1897 increased by 15 times. In this area the dominant position occupied entrepreneurs Yahnenko, Symyrenko, Kharytonenkos, Brodsky. By the mid 90's 153 sugar mills Ukraine produced 23.9 million. Tons of sugar.</p>
<p>In the 90's. Ukraine gave more than half of agricultural machines. In 1895 started the construction of the Kharkiv Locomotive and next year - Lugansk Machine-Building Plant. For 1900, these plants produced 233 locomotives (23.3% of the all production).</p>
<p>Industrialization contributed to the development of cities. Particularly rapidly Odessa, which came in first place in the Ukraine by the number of industrial enterprises and the volume of industrial production. In 1879 Odessa was 159 enterprises, and in 1890 - 322 (c t. Ch. 14 steam mills, 11 foundry and mechanical factories, jute bags, etc.). Odessa port runner for freight between seaports (after St. Petersburg).</p>
<p>Industrial development was accompanied by heavy rail construction. The first railway length is 196 miles - Balta, Odessa - was built in 1865 over the 1866-1879 biennium. In Ukraine laid over 4.5 thousand. Miles of tracks. At the end of the XIX century. length of railways in Ukraine amounted to 1/5 of the entire railway network of the Russian Empire; Railways have tied up all the major cities of Ukraine each other and the Black Sea ports and industrial centers of Russia. By the rivers of Ukraine there were 220 ships.</p>
<p>Industrialization increased the share of industrial production in Ukraine Empire (20% in 1900), led to an increase in the number of cities (in 1897 lived in urban areas 16% of the population of Eastern Ukraine).</p>
<p>The turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Ukraine has been in a period of completion of the industrial revolution and the transition to industrialization, which consisted in the development of large-scale machine industry, qualitative change in the structure of the economy (industry had to take precedence over agriculture, heavy industry - over easy). These large-scale dramatic changes taking place in a complex environment. Empire as the most advanced countries in the world, 1900-1903. Survived the economic crisis. 1904-1908 biennium. Were the years of the depression, and only in years 1909-1913. Began industrial growth.</p>
<p>Ukrainian industry-wide evolving in line with economic trends, both by virtue of circumstances (favorable geographical location, natural resources, cheap but skilled labor force, etc.) Had its own peculiarities. The economic crisis, exacerbating competition, increasing polarization companies made the bourgeoisie maximum focus and combine forces. At the beginning of the twentieth century. Ukraine in terms of concentration of industrial production in key sectors was not only the leader of the Russian empire, but also ranked among the highest in the world. The five largest southern metal works (Uzovskij, Dnieper, Alexander, Peter, Donetsk-Yurievsky) produced about 25% of the all cast iron. Plants Brodsky Tereshchenko, Kharitonenko, Yaroshinsky Bobrinsky and producing about 60% of refined sugar in the Russian Empire. Large companies (over 500 people) in Ukraine had more than 44% of all workers, while in the US - only 33%.</p>
<p>The concentration of industrial production set the stage for the process of monopolization and thus the formation of monopolies began first with the most "concentrated" industries - metallurgy, coal, iron ore and others. At the beginning of the century grow syndicates "Prodvagon" (1901), "Prodamet" (1902), "Truboprodazha" (1902), "Nail" (1903). It was a very powerful union. For example, established in 1904 syndicate "Produhol", which included 18 separate joint stock companies controlled 75% of the coal in the Donets Basin. However, the super-profits the bourgeoisie even in times of crisis, while monopolies retarded economic development hindered technological progress, narrowed the scope of the regulatory impact of market relations.</p>
<p>Monopolies Ukraine were closely related not only to the Russian bourgeoisie, but also with foreign capital. Western bourgeoisie attracted enormous natural resources, cheap labor, high profit margins, broad market. It is significant that more than 25% of foreign investment in industry Empire falls on Ukraine. For example, in the coal industry 63% of the capital stock were owned by foreign companies, and the industry - 90%. A powerful syndicate "Produhol" virtually completely controlled by the French investytoramy. This hindered the economic development and deformed not only Dnieper Ukraine and the whole Empire, as a domestic manufacturer vytisnyavsya the market, and most of the profits generated from the monopoly prices and government military orders, exported abroad.</p>
<p>An important feature of industrial development in Ukraine was an uneven development of its regions. If southern Ukraine quickly moved to capitalist rails and began rapidly developing industrial production, the western region focusing mainly on agriculture, and then dominated petty way. Left Bank, where the remnants of serfdom were preserved, significantly lagging behind other regions of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Gradually, the Ukrainian lands has developed a specialized industrial areas. Donbass became the center of the coal industry, the Nikopol basin - manganese, Krivoy Rog - iron, Right Bank and Left Bank to some extent - the sugar. These centers of industrial production eventually became all-important. This process contributed significantly faster compared to to general, the rate of growth of key industries. If the period between 1870 and 1900 iron ore production in the Urals, the share of industry in total output of the economy accounted for around 48.2%, while the equivalent-wide figure was only 40%. Ukrainian lands in the late XIX - early XX century. become one of the key industrial areas of the Russian Empire. It was here in 1913 produced 69% of all-iron production, 57% steel and 58% of the rental. In Ukraine at that time accounted for 20.2% of all machinery and metal industry in Russia.</p>
<p>However, despite the fact that the territory of Ukraine was focused a tremendous industrial potential, it still remained an agricultural area of ​​the empire, in which villages inhabited by 80% of the population.</p>
<p>Imperial Center, pursuing traditional policies deformed and impeded economic development of Ukraine, seeing in this region especially strong raw material base. According to some, it is the Ukrainian industry in 1913 accounted for almost 70% of all raw materials and semi Empire and only 15% of the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>In Western Ukraine after 1848 feudal order is not hindered economic growth. But here there was no such rapid growth of productive forces, as in other parts of the Habsburg Empire. The economic situation even worse. This was due to the fact that since 1861 (built-Vienna railway Lviv), begins the widespread railroad construction, which united land west of the main industrial centers of the empire. It seemed like it would contribute to economic growth, as in the leading countries of Europe. But in the end to a flood of goods from the industrialized regions of the empire (Austria, Czech Republic), which destroyed local industries and destroyed all the traditional economic system. All this has been accompanied by rapid population growth.</p>
<p>To save the situation the local administration of the province has tried to overcome this economic imbalance development of the banking and credit system and investment. By the early twentieth century. contributed to some positive changes.</p>
<p>Interest of foreign capital caused deposits of oil, minerals, vast tracts of forest. As a consequence, have developed rapidly the oil and forestry industries. In the late nineteenth century. foreign capital took the leading position in the economy of Western Ukraine. Large firms going over trade, banks and entire industries.</p>
<p>The professional structure of the population of Western Ukraine and the central provinces of the Austrian Empire</p>
<p>Agriculture Western lands developed very slowly. It was not only the largest agricultural region of the empire, but also the region with the lowest level of agricultural production. Huge tracts of land owned by landlords, while most peasants constantly suffered from land hunger, despite not some expansion of acreage. The natural population growth further aggravated the situation. Intolerable conditions of existence and the specter of starvation causing the departure of peasants in search of work to other countries.</p>
<p>Western industry developed slow pace. The vast majority of industrial workers did not work in a large factory industry and for small enterprises and workshops. According to official data, in 1885 in Eastern Galicia in 175 manufacturing industry with the number of workers over 20 were only 10 thousand. Shower. In Transcarpathia at the same time there have been several similar enterprises, and in Bukovina were not there.</p>
<p>The branch structure of industry land was lopsided. The bulk of the product gave the field of extraction and processing of local raw materials - wood, timber, oil, brown coal, salt. The largest branch of industry was oil, which has been developing since the 70's. The nineteenth century. Centre for the oil industry was Borislav. Control of the development of this industry once established Austrian and German entrepreneurs. The interest in importing oil Galician encourage them to use technical improvements. This has resulted in the growth of oil production from 20 thousand. Tonnes per year in 1874 to 326 thousand. Tonnes in 1900, accounting for 4% of world production. But the Viennese government prevented the construction of oil refineries in Eastern Galicia. Galician oil processed into Austrian and Hungarian factories. Although oil and kerosene production steadily increased, farmers did not have what to buy and lit their homes thorn.</p>
<p>The large number of high-quality wood (oak, fir and beech) resulted in the second half of the 60 - early 70's. The rapid development of sawmilling industry. Foreign entrepreneurs bought for a song or rented from the landlords and cut down their arrays. To the forest regions of the Carpathians were built railways and mahogany exported to Germany, Austria, Italy, England, France, Turkey and other countries. In the early twentieth century. from the Carpathians annually exported 608 million cubic meters. of the forest.</p>
<p>If the sawmill industry developed rapidly, the rate of development of furniture and other industries woodworking industry were very slow. Foreign entrepreneurs are willing to invest in their development. Buyers Western population in furniture, paper and cardboard are met with imported products.</p>
<p>Among the least developed sectors included easy and metalworking industries. Light industry remained at the stage of small craft and could not compete with the Austrian and Hungarian factory production. Local weavers, shoemakers and tailors provide clothing and footwear only the rural population, and commoners wore clothes from fabrics of Western European textile mills. "Production of textiles and yarn, from the shirt down to the carpet, - wrote a contemporary Galician economists - iron and metal products, tools, machinery, fertilizer ... in short all that man needs from cradle to grave until almost all import , buy, borrow in foreign. "</p>
<p>The largest enterprises of the region were railroad repair shops in Ukraine, and Stanislav Striy. However, they do overhaul of rolling stock was not possible, and the machines were sent to Germany. Formation of the manufacturing industry in the region was extremely slow. In the second half of the nineteenth century. in the province were only five large state tobacco factories (Eastern Galicia - four in Transcarpathia - one), which employed four thousand. workers. In Eastern Galicia there were also a number of match factories, metallurgical and machine-building enterprises.</p>
<p>Industrial development has been associated with the emergence of new social strata - workers. In the late nineteenth century. their number in the region amounted to about 55 thousand. The sources of replenishment operation was ruined artisans and peasants.</p>
<p>The position of Western workers were among the worst in Europe.</p>
<p>Wages of industrial workers in the province was a half times lower than in the central areas of the empire. According to official data of Austrian institutions, wages of workers in Ukraine amounted to 48-58% from their colleagues in Vienna.</p>
<p>Agricultural reforms implemented at Western during the revolution of 1848-1849., Freed the peasants from serfdom residues, but their situation remains very serious. During his release villagers had for 50 years to pay annual fees. In general reform of 1848 has cost the Western peasantry over 300 million florins.</p>
<p>In favor of landlords and resolve the land issue. Although, according to the reform for the peasants had maintained the lands they enjoyed, landlords took from them more fertile grounds. Thus, after 1848 the landlords remained in eastern Galicia - 44% better land, in Bukovina - 54% in Transcarpathia - 70%. Western areas were land, where the sector accounted for the main picture of small farms of 2-5 ha in size (80% of farms) that do not provide the minimum needs of the farmer and large land holdings of 15-20 thousand. Ha.</p>
<p>Consequently, the evolution of agriculture took place very slowly. In economic relations between peasants and landowners dominated refining - on borrowed grain to rent the land for firewood and more. Only in the late nineteenth century. refining began to give way to wage labor.</p>
<p>One of the main issues for the farmer at the time was right to use the easement. Not able to farming without the use of forests and grazing was evident. But landowners were administered pre excessive price for their use, understanding that ultimately lead nowhere. Expectations of thousands of peasants to find justice in the courts were in vain. During the 1848-1881 biennium. In the courts of the land considered 32 thousand. Cases of rights to easements from landowners whose favor it was decided to 30 thousand.</p>
<p>The inability of most farmers to provide themselves with the necessary thanks to the work in our own economy has forced them to seek additional income. Many went rotten to the large landowners. However, their work, they received four times less than the agricultural workers in other provinces of the Habsburg Empire. Another output was the mass emigration.</p>
<p>A new challenge in life napivzhebratskomu Western peasantry was usury. Forced to borrow money to pay many taxes, farmers quickly found themselves in dependence on moneylenders who resort to shameless fraud, under the pretext of paying principal and interest on it (on average 150-250%) selected their economy. The result was a hopeless situation of peasants spread of alcoholism. Landowners themselves often pushing them to do so, instead of giving paid to work laborers coupons that they can be realized only in the tavern. It is not surprising that in the late nineteenth century. Eastern Galicia fell one tavern for every 230 inhabitants, while the primary school - for every 1500. Poverty poor western farmer became a problem, which was known and which resented in many European countries.</p>
<p>The main branch of agriculture in the region was agriculture. Because of the poverty of the peasants advances in cultivation was negligible. New farm equipment factory production even in the late nineteenth century. used only a few wealthy households. The abundance of cheap labor landless peasants did not cheap imports unprofitable cars from the western regions of the empire, or even from England. The slow introduction of agricultural science, outdated technology cultivation conditioned low yields. During the second half of the nineteenth century. crop production in the region was one and a half times lower than in Western countries.</p>
<p>And yet, though slowly, look western village changed. The vast majority of peasants were forced to go to work. Formed a new social group of Western farmers in business. In contrast to the urban bourgeoisie and landowners, farmers, entrepreneurs were mostly Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Layering farmers at Western</p>
<p>During the second half of the nineteenth century. agricultural lands of Western agrarian evolution occurred gradually, by which it passed on market development path. The policy of the Habsburg monarchy entailed that this evolution took place very slowly, in conjunction with the impoverishment of the peasants.</p>
