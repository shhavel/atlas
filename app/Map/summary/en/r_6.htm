<p>Differences climate in different parts of the globe caused by three main factors: latitude areas, the movement of air masses and the nature of the underlying surface.</p>
<p>Climate map shows the parameters that are fundamental to characterize the weather and climate.</p>
<p>According to the amount of solar radiation forming temperature conditions that affect the climate of different areas. Depending on the angle of incidence of sunlight different parts of the world receive unequal amount of solar radiation. The number of radiation decreases from the equator to the poles, mostly with zonal distribution. However, due to a number of factors (transparency of the atmosphere, the absolute altitude, duration of illumination) such zoning is often violated.</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of the received solar radiation and air temperature changes. But zonal temperature distribution is broken (it shows isotherms - lines connecting places with the same values ​​of temperature). Alternating between the oceans and land, the size of continents, terrain, presence of streams - these are the main factors causing temperature differences between areas of the middle latitude values.</p>
<p>Long-term displacement povitryannyh mass determines the distribution of atmospheric pressure. On the ground, formed three zones of low (at the equator and in temperate latitudes) and four - high (tropical and polar latitudes of both hemispheres) pressure.</p>
<p>Depending on the general circulation of the atmosphere and the water vapor content in the air is the distribution of rainfall on the planet. Precipitation formed when saturated moist air rises and cools, causing condensation of vapor. Rainfall greater where prevailing low blood pressure, and in areas of cyclones and atmospheric fronts. And vice versa - much less rainfall in areas of high pressure dominated by anticyclones.</p>
<p>Because the oceans are a supplier of moisture in the atmosphere, most precipitation falls in the southern hemisphere, because it is dominated by sea. Rainfall also varies throughout the year. Most of them falls in the warmer months.</p>
<p>Typically, with distance from the ocean inland continental climate becomes drier as rainfall in coastal areas. However, there are places on the climate map of the world where practically no rain and the ocean. This is due to the passage near cold currents. Chilled water area over such poor air to moisture and does not form clouds. That's why the ocean formed hottest Atacama Desert in South America and the Namib Desert in Africa. Significantly affect the distribution of temperature and precipitation and heat flow. North Atlantic current, for example, makes a significant impact on mitigating climate of Scandinavia.</p>
