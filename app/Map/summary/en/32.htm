<p>Transport - an important component of the economy of any country. This is the basis of international geographical division of labor, providing production and non-production needs of the economy and population in all kinds of traffic.</p>
<p>The main technical and economic indicators of transport are traffic volumes, the turnover (work volume of freight over a distance), the passenger, speed, productivity, cost of transportation, the bandwidth runs, agility, depending on weather and seasonal changes. Different modes of transport have their own advantages and disadvantages, so use them depending on the specific conditions.</p>
<p>The main modes of transport: land (rail, road), water (sea, river, lake), others (pipeline, aviation, electronic).</p>
<p>Railway transport operates in 160 countries, ranking second in terms of cargo turnover (after the sea) and the passenger (after car). Job railways reflects the state of the economy. With its growth increase freight turnover, and increase the speed and intensity of trains. Thanks to the electrification of roads reduced the negative impact of transport on the environment. Leaders on the length of railways is a big country: USA, Canada, Russia, India and China. The greatest density of railways in Europe and Japan. Least-developed rail transport in Africa.</p>
<p>Road transport is the most maneuverable (driving up cargo and passengers from gate to gate). The length of roads is increasing. In 2002, it amounted to 25 million km. In developed countries, have spread motorways - speed highway superior. The longest roads in the US, Japan, Western Europe.</p>
<p>Rapidly growing pipeline. Gas and oil pipeline network is represented on the map, "Oil and gas industry." Modern technological advances make it possible to lay submarine pipelines. The longest of these Mediterranean gas pipeline connecting Algeria to Italy.</p>
<p>Maritime transport services primarily to international trade. About half of its tonnage fell on oil and oil products. Major shipping lanes pass through the Atlantic Ocean, on the coasts of which are located the biggest ports in the world: Shanghai, Singapore, Rotterdam, New York, Philadelphia, Marseille, London. The busiest areas of sea routes are marine channels: Suez (Egypt), Panama, Kiel (Germany).</p>
<p>River and lake transport is particularly important in Russia, USA, Canada. The main navigable rivers of the world - a Mississippi Missouri, Rhine, Danube, Volga, Dnieper, Paran√°, Mekong, and others.</p>
<p>Air transport is the most expensive, but the pace of development is ahead of all other modes of transport. Particularly relevant it is for countries with a large territory and the presence of inaccessible areas, as well as in international passenger traffic. By the number of air traffic leading US, Japan, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia. Major airports of the world are represented on the map. More than just takes passengers airport Atlanta (USA) - 86 million passengers annually.</p>
