<p>The first information about the geographical discoveries date back to the third millennium BC. Egyptian sailors mastered the sea route to the east coast of Africa and the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. However, the best sailors of the ancient world, of course, were the Phoenicians. In the VI. BC they discovered a sea route around Africa, which was updated only 2000 years later.</p>
<p>For five centuries before Columbus's ships have crossed the expanse of Norman North Atlantic. It Norsemen discovered Iceland, Greenland and established their settlements in North America. Greatly expanded the horizons of geographical knowledge Arab travelers. Arab geographer Idrisi Maps (1100-1165 gg.) Is evidence of a deeper knowledge of contemporary geographical Arabs compared to Europeans. And presently retains its value drawn Moroccan Ibn Battuta (1304-1377 gg.) Description visited his country. The enormous amount of geographical knowledge was gained in China. So even in the thirteenth century. e. e. is conducted observation of the weather, and in the second century. conducted a census. It is the Chinese discovered the water cycle, used in navigation compass, concluded many maps.</p>
<p>It has long attracted Europeans India and China. But the overland route to these countries was extremely difficult and dangerous. It goes through the hot deserts, high mountains and broad river. And despite all the difficulties of the Venetian merchant Marco Polo in the 1271-1295 biennium. Managed to travel deep into Asia. The path is only one way lasted more than four years. About 17 years Polo held in China, the accumulated knowledge of this exotic country were the basis for the book, which was almost the first systematic source of knowledge in Europe about Asia.</p>
<p>A half century after the trip Polo in the 1468-1474 biennium. Tver merchant Athanasius Nikitin visited Persia and India. He notes "Journey Beyond Three Seas" where he describes his six-year journey, is also valuable literary and historical monument.</p>
<p>Rumors of India with its fabulous wealth led to the search for an easier way to this fabulous country. Based on the assumption of sphericity of the Earth, henuezets Christopher Columbus was convinced that India can reach by sea, heading across the Atlantic Ocean to the west. After years of appeals to the governments of different countries Columbus finally got the money for the expedition of the Spanish queen. At dawn on August 3, 1492 three ships under the Spanish flag went in search of the shortest route to India. The expedition seemed much longer than expected sailors. Several times exhausted team members required to turn the ship back. Only the resilience and perseverance of Columbus expedition rescued from collapse. And behold, October 12, 1492 sailors saw land. It was a small island with a group of the Bahamas, Columbus named San Salvador ("Holy Savior"). In search of El Dorado expedition of Columbus opened a lot of islands, among them Juan (Cuba) and Espanola (Haiti). Travelers can be sure that India achieved because the natives mistakenly called Indians and Islands - West Indies.</p>
<p>Throughout the 11 years, Columbus led three expeditions to the West Indies, by opening more than 700 islands. However, all these trips only shake his credibility. After the second voyage to the West Indies (1493 - 1496 gg.) Christopher Columbus lost all privileges. After the humiliation he still has the right to manage his third tour in the summer of 1498. With her in 1500's journey brought them to Spain in chains, depriving him of the title of Governor of open land. And just indignation of the Spaniards forced the government to partly mitigate their attitude to the navigator. In 1502 Christopher Columbus once again managed to go to the West, and that's what swimming was most unfortunate. During his travels, he found a lot of gold, on which both counted and found out that he has reached this coveted East. Because of this, Columbus spent the last years of his life in poverty and fighting for the king promised him the privilege. And though he got his wanderings coast of South America, Christopher Columbus until his death he did not know who discovered a new continent.</p>
<p>In the 1499-1504 biennium. Florentine Amerigo Vespucci organized three expeditions to new lands and first suggested to him that India is not, and the unknown continent of the New World. Therefore Lorraine cartographer Martin Valdzemyuller on world map, published in 1507, described a new continent America.</p>
<p>In the 1497-1499 biennium. Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama rounded the southern tip of Africa - Cape Agulhas, sailed along the east coast of Africa, crossed the Indian Ocean for 23 days and reached the shores real India. But achieving da Gama was a continuation of another Portuguese traveler Research Bartolomeu Dias, who ten years before his first rounded the Cape called the Cape of Good Hope. But then, being forced to yield to the demands of the sailors, Dias took the hard decision to turn back.</p>
<p>As the eastern route to India was controlled by the Portuguese, in 1519 Spain was organized an expedition in search of the way to the western islands of spices. From Seville caravel led by flagship "Trinidad" under the direction of Ferdinand Magellan embarked on west. Way to America did not cause much trouble, but the journey to the south, along the banks of a little-known continent, took the entire 14 months. In search of the strait between the oceans sailors had to examine each bay before for high cape they found the strait later named Ma“ëellanovoyu. After crossing the unknown ocean, March 5, 1521 the expedition reached the Philippine Islands. During the trip, the weather was favorable, and the ocean calm, so Magellan named it the Pacific. The purpose of the expedition was attained, but Magellan's journey ended in the Philippines, he was killed in a skirmish with the natives. Only one caravel "Victoria" back home. Of the 265 sailors native shores saw only 18. Spices brought from the Moluccas, fully compensated for the costs of the expedition. Thus ended the first round the world, the results of which confirmed the assumption of sphericity of the Earth. In addition, there were more precisely defined size of the globe and value her water and land and proved the existence of one of the oceans. In the 1577-1580 biennium. English explorer Francis Drake made a second after Magellan's trip around the world in more detail by examining the west coast of the Americas.</p>
<p>In 1606, the Dutch reached the Australian mainland and named New Holland. Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman in the 1642-1644 biennium. Discovered New Zealand Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Tasmania (named after him), explored the north-west coast of New Holland.</p>
