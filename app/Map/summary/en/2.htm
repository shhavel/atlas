<p>The war turned into a tragedy for the Ukrainian people. 3.5 million Ukrainian mobilized the Russian army, and 250 thousand. Ukrainian Galicia and Bukovina - the Austro-Hungarian.</p>
<p>Military confrontation between the two empires split nationally conscious Ukrainian. Frankly proavstriysku position occupied founded in August 1914 in Lviv, Ukrainian Main Board (SRB) led by K. Levitsky. Defence was the inter-block with representatives of radical, social-democratic, national-democratic parties. Defence appealed to the Ukrainian people on the Manifesto, in which, inter alia, stated: "gluttony tsarist empire also threatens our national life ... which has found protection in the constitutional structure of the Austrian State ... Let Ukrainian citizenship give all their material and moral forces that to the historic enemy of Ukraine was defeated! Let the ruins of the tsarist empire sunrise liberated Ukraine! "</p>
<p>In 1914 on the initiative of Defence was formed Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (USS).</p>
<p>In May 1915 Ukrainian Main Board reorganized in Vienna in general Ukrainian parliament - the only and highest representative body of the Ukrainian people of Eastern Galicia. Council sought from the Austrian government administration and implementation of Ukrainian schools in areas associated Holm and Volyn, agreement on the division of Galicia into Ukrainian and Polish parts and the formation of Ukrainian university in Lviv. German and Austro-Hungarian authorities did not support the idea of ​​an independent Ukraine, but satisfy a number of minor, including the organization of some Ukrainian POW camp. The camps founded schools, libraries, churches that are actively engaged in the education of Ukrainian national consciousness, a relentless hatred of the Russian Empire as ponevolyuvachky and hnobytelky Ukrainian people. Over time, the Ukrainian prisoners in Germany and Austria-Hungary was set up under two divisions - "synozhupannu" and "sirozhupannu", named for the color of the form.</p>
<p>November 5, 1916 the Austro-Hungarian and German governments proclaimed the creation of an independent Polish kingdom, consisting of Polish lands that were part of the Russian Empire and later Galicia. In protest Ukrainian General Council disbanded. Management of the Ukrainian movement in Western Ukraine was concentrated in Ukrainian parliamentary representation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the political emigrants from Eastern Ukraine was founded in Lviv Union for the Liberation of Ukraine (SVU), declaring his non-partisan civic organization. Organized by IED were former leaders of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party (USDRP) - A beetle, D. Doroshenko, Dontsov and Ukrainian Social Democratic Union (Union) - M. Melenevskyi (Basok) and A. cursive-Yoltuhovskyy.</p>
<p>In October 1914 issued SVU program "Our platform", according to which the main objective of the Union was to create an independent Ukrainian state constitutional monarchical form of government. Main bid he made on Austria-Hungary, the German army, anticipating defeat in the war.</p>
<p>SVU had their plenipotentiaries in Berlin, Sofia, Istanbul, Rome, Stockholm, Oslo. Having set the task of forming a coalition around Union implacable enemies of the empire, these representatives entered into open or secret negotiations with both official state officials, and with the Russian political emigrants, mostly from the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. But to reach an agreement is not always successful.</p>
<p>1915 members SVU started publishing in the Ukrainian language newspaper in the capital of Bulgaria "The working Flag", launched agitation and propaganda work in the camps of war. The money provided by the Governments of Germany and Austria-Hungary, SVU has great propaganda. Union figures spoke with lectures and presentations not only in Austria-Hungary, but also in Germany and Bulgaria. They have established regular edition Ukrainian, German, Bulgarian, Turkish, Romanian, Czech, Croatian, Italian and Swedish versions of many popular science books on the historical past and the modern Ukraine. Among them, "Kobzar" Shevchenko, Ukrainian historiography labor luminaries N.Kostomarov, V. Antonovich, F. Wolf, scientist geographer S. Rudnitsky, M. Lozinski publicist, writer Lepkoho. There have been some published work Hrushevskoho though he belonged to the IED ambivalent. The assistance provided to the Quadruple Alliance, credited as the national debt for future independent Ukraine. Union for the Liberation of Ukraine ceased operations in June 1918 Historic merit IED was primarily that it was the first Ukrainian organizations declared aim to form an independent Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>Early in the war, Moscophils immigrants from Galicia organized in Kiev "Carpatho-Russian osvobodytelnyy committee." He called Galicians welcome the Russian army as vyzvolytelku helped organize authorities during the occupation of Galicia.</p>
<p>Proavstriyski and pro-German sentiments IED found no response in eastern Ukraine. The editor of the magazine "Ukrainian life" in Moscow Petliura called Ukrainian honestly fulfill its duty to the Russian state. In foreign policy, Petliura encouraged to focus on the Entente.</p>
<p>Association of Ukrainian progressives (TUP) took a holding position, not standing on the platform Petliura or IED. But even the loyalty of Ukrainian leaders to the Russian autocracy not softened its bias towards Ukraine. This Ukrainian convinced that only in the national movement can be solved Ukrainian question.</p>
<p>Since 1916 in the cities of Ukraine are beginning to have a mass nationalist groups of young people, mostly students, who advocated the independence of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In August 1914 Defence established in Lviv city council USS combat, which appealed to the Austrian government for permission to form the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (USS). Record up to USS was performed on a completely voluntary basis. Those wishing to join turned 28 ths. Persons. The main contingent of students were paramilitary Ukrainian youth organizations "Falcon", "January", "Plast". The Austrian government, concerned about the presence of such a large nationally conscious forces, to the USS scored only 2.5 thousand. People. Legion, which consisted of three huts, joined the Austrian army of General Bormann. With the approach of the front to the Austrian city of command tried to throw into battle unprepared legion. But then provisional Commander T. Rozhankovskyy refused to comply with this order. Later Legion headed lieutenant M. Haluschynskyy. After taking the oath legion was transferred to Transcarpathia. Plans Austrian command consisted in the gradual destruction of the USS in battle with the enemy. Some units of the Legion were transferred to protect Verets'ki and Uzhotskoho passes (September 1914). The rest were ordered in groups of 20 people to break into the rear of the Russian forces for sabotage. However, these operations proved ineffective, and Sich suffered significant losses. After the Austrian command has changed his views on the fate of the shooters who were among the most combat-ready soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian army. In December 1915 Volunteer Legion USS pereformuvaly a regular regiment of the Austrian army. USS distinguished themselves in the battle for the feet of the mountain (March 1915), the release of Galicia from Russian occupation. But the battle for Mount Lysonia in Ternopil (September 1916) was the last regiment to USS. The remnants of the regiment moved to Volhynia, where shooters were obliged to assist the Austrian occupation authorities replenish the Austrian army recruits from the local population. Using this, the Sich Riflemen just started a great educational work. So, they organized some 100 elementary schools and teachers working there. After the re-formation of the regiment in February 1917 Sich returned to the front at p. Bershad. March - October 1918 USS regiment under the command of the centurion A. Mykytka part of the Austro-Hungarian army, under the terms of the Brest Peace Treaty in 1918, a campaign in Dnieper Ukraine (Zhmerinka - Kherson - Oleksandrivsk). In early October 1918 USS transferred to Bukovina in Chernivtsi. After the proclamation ZUNR in November 1918 the regiment redeployed to the city, where it became the core of the Ukrainian Galician Army (UHA).</p>
<p>In late December 1917 with former prisoners Sich and immigrants from Galicia in Kiev, established the Galicia-Bukovina tent riflemen. Kurin riflemen (as he was called from the beginning of 1918) fully supported the UCR, becoming one of the best parts of the UNR Army.</p>
<p>Thus, the Sich Riflemen, taking an active part in the First World War, became the basis of a future Ukrainian army as at Western and in the Dnieper, which by 1921 led an impossible fight, defending the gains of the Ukrainian revolution.</p>
