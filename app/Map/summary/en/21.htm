<p>An aerial shell that surrounds the Earth and rotates with it, is called the atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere - a mixture of many gases, which are in a state of suspended solid and liquid particles, dust, ash, soot. Surface layer of air consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other gases.</p>
<p>The limits of the atmosphere is difficult to determine exactly. Lower limit is the surface, but keep in mind that air gets into all the cracks and pores of rocks. The upper limit is about 3000 km altitude, but the air is so thin that talk about a solid shell anymore. The atmosphere is composed of five layers. The bottom layer - the troposphere, 90% of the mass of the air and almost all water vapor. It formed clouds and precipitation falls. The upper limit of the troposphere is at an altitude of 8 km in polar latitudes and 18 km - near the equator. Above the troposphere - stratosphere, which extends up to 50 km above the earth's surface. In the stratosphere the air has a much lower density compared to the troposphere. Here is the ozone layer that protects Earth from harmful effects of cosmic radiation. Mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere are the upper layers of the atmosphere of a rarefied air and extremes in temperature. In the troposphere, the temperature decreases by 0.6 degrees every 100 m ascent up. In the stratosphere, the reverse process, and the temperature increases by 1.2 degrees every kilometer. In the mesosphere temperature decreases again up to the mark - 100 ° C. Then there is a constant increase in temperature.</p>
<p>The physical condition of the lower layer of the atmosphere at a particular time in a particular area is called weather. Weather defined six basic parameters: temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, speed, strength and direction of wind, clouds and precipitation.</p>
<p>The basic source of life on Earth is the Sun's energy. At the Earth enters a dvomilyardna of this energy, the other - scattered in space. Falling on the Earth's surface, the sun's rays heat it, and even hot air from the surface of the troposphere. That is why air temperature decreases with height. Changed it and overnight. It is highest at 14 o'clock, and the lowest just before sunrise. The temperature also depends on the latitude, since the larger the angle of sunlight and the higher the sun, the temperature is higher. The difference between the highest and lowest temperatures is called the amplitude of temperature fluctuations. The annual amplitude of temperature increases from the equator to the poles. At the equator it is around 1 ° C, and in our latitudes 25-30 ° C.</p>
<p>Atmosphere easy. One cubic meter of air weighs 1 kg 300 g, however, the air exerts pressure on all objects and organisms on the earth's surface. This is called atmospheric pressure. For each of us puts pressure column of air mass around 15 tons. Atmospheric pressure is measured with a barometer. The first barometer was mercurial, and was a sealed on one side meter glass tube filled with mercury and immersed in a vessel with the liquid. At the latitude of 45 °, at sea level, at 0 ° C height of the column of mercury barometer is 760 mm. This pressure is taken as normal atmospheric. Much easier to use for mercury is aneroid barometer, which is a metal box with pumped air. By increasing the pressure squeezed the bottom of the box, with a decrease - on the contrary. This change fixes an arrow pointing to the scale of the value of atmospheric pressure in mmHg. For every 100 m rise of atmospheric pressure reduced to 10 mmHg.</p>
<p>During heating, the air expands, becomes lighter and rises up. The pressure on the surface is reduced. When the air is cooled, it is styskayuchys becomes heavier, falls and more pressure on the surface. Air masses are constantly moving from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. Such horizontal movement of air is called wind. On the coast, there is a large water bodies breeze - wind that twice daily changing direction. During the day it blows from the sea into dry land, as land under sunlight heats up faster and the pressure on it decreases. Night - on the contrary. There are seasonal winds - the monsoons. Monsoons blow from the sea on dry ground in the summer and bringing a lot of rain because of the moist sea air. Winter monsoons blow from land to sea and bring dry weather. The reason for the formation of the monsoon and the same as in the formation of splashes - not the same heating rate of the sea and land.</p>
<p>The force of the wind depends on its speed, which is determined using a special device - the anemometer. Wind speed is determined in m / s, and power - in points. The lack of wind is called the calm, and the wind force 12 points when speed exceeds 29 m / s - hurricane. Wind direction can be determined by a weather vane. Flyuherka (arrow vane) always points to go where the wind blows. This area is called the wind direction.</p>
<p>In the troposphere, contains a lot of water vapor. Humidity is measured in grams per 1 cubic meter. It depends on the temperature. The warmer the air, the more moisture it can hold. There are absolute and relative humidity. Absolute humidity - the maximum amount of water vapor that can be contained in a unit volume of air at a certain temperature. It is lowest in Antarctica - hundredths of a gram in 1 cubic meter of air, the largest in the equatorial zone - more than 23 g / cu. In Ukraine, the figure is an average of in January - 3 g / cu. In July -12 g / cu. Relative humidity - the ratio of actual water vapor content in the air to the maximum possible at a given temperature, expressed as a percentage. Highest relative humidity in the morning, the lowest - in the afternoon. Measure the relative humidity hygrometer.</p>
<p>The temperature in the troposphere decreases. There comes a time when saturated moist air can not hold the water vapor in itself and it condenses and turns into water droplets that hang in the air. If the air temperature is below 0 ° C, the droplets are transformed into small ice crystals. Cluster suspended in the atmosphere of small water droplets or ice crystals are called clouds, and the degree of coverage of the sky with clouds called clouds. There are many types of clouds, but the most common stratus, cumulus and cirrus clouds. Layered clouds hang low over the ground, densely covering the sky. Fog is also a regular stratus. Cumulus clouds are at an altitude of 2-3 km. They resemble pieces of wool. A large number indicates a possible precipitation. Cirrus clouds are formed at an altitude of 6 km. They are translucent and resemble feathers. Their presence indicates a change in the weather. Cloudiness determined in points, from 0 for clear weather to 10 with solid lingering clouds of heaven.</p>
<p>The water that falls from the clouds, or directly from the air in the liquid or solid state, is called precipitation. By liquid precipitation are rain, dew, fog, to solid - hail, snow, frost. Measured rainfall water layer (in mm), which is formed when water is not flowing, and does not evaporate. It uses the device - Rain gauge. To determine the thickness of the snow used snihomirnyh rail.</p>
<p>Long-term weather regime in the area called climate. Because of the uneven heating of the earth's surface climate in different parts of the world is very different. Spherical shape of the Earth's rotation axis tilt and annual motion around the sun causes uneven flow of heat in different parts of the globe. Gets the warmest equatorial part, the least - Polar. Depending on the amount of heat coming to Earth, the entire surface is divided into thermal zones, or zones sunlight. There are tropical, two moderate (North and South) and two polar (North and South) zones. The whole territory of Ukraine is within the Northern temperate zone (zone coverage).</p>
