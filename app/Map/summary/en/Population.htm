<p>Any city increases when it becomes attractive to the population of the surrounding area. Kyiv, of course, is no exception to this rule. Therefore, in those periods when the area and number of inhabitants increased Kyiv, & laquo; root & raquo; Kiev are in a minority, and the aliens and their immediate descendants & mdash; in the majority.</p>
<p>How to change the number of Kiev, is clearly seen in the chart, which covers the period from the tenth to the twentieth century. The first big & laquo; surge & raquo; took place at the turn of X & mdash; XI cent., when the capital of Russia experienced its finest hour. Reaching a huge number of the Middle Ages 35 & mdash; 50 thousand people, population growth Kyiv halt. Mongol invasion led to the city dramatically reduced its size, and the following centuries were not conducive to their rapid recovery. Although the number of people of Kiev has grown steadily, wars and epidemics periodically hindered the process. Only in the nineteenth century. When Kyiv became a significant military and administrative center and university center, the city became a permanent center of gravity for a large area, which began & laquo; give & raquo; city ​​of its inhabitants. Particularly rapid growth was after the construction of the railway and turn the city into & laquo; sugar capital & raquo; Russian Empire. First World War Kyiv met while in population among cities in the state on the 4th place (after Peterburґa, Moscow and Warsaw).</p>
<p>The First World War slowed development of the city, and the revolution and the subsequent decline of the economy led to a significant reduction of Kyiv residents. However, following Soviet period Kyiv began to grow again, especially since in 1934 it became the capital of the Ukrainian SSR. During the Second World War as a result of the Nazi occupation of the city of nearly depopulated, but after the war the capital zahoyila wounds and already in 1959 became city-millionaire. Growth Kyiv continues in the era of independent Ukraine, although the economic crisis of the 1990s somewhat halted this process.</p>
<p>The larger the population, the greater its area. In the Middle Ages Kyiv was compared with the present, extremely small and consisted of three separate parts of each other & mdash; Upper Town, hem and Caves. During the XVIII & mdash; XIX centuries these ancient historical areas together in a single unit, they added new & mdash; Limes, New Buildings, Lukyanivka and others. In 1914 had a modern urban core (the area between the Dnieper and Lybeddyu), which tended suburbs (Priorka, Kurenivka, Shuliavka, Demiivka), suburban village (squirrel, Juliani, Borschagovki, Mousetrap, pies), housing estates (Svyatoshin, Pusha -Vodytsya). At the beginning of the Soviet era the city annexed the territory on the left bank. The fastest growth rates occurred in the area of ​​Kyiv in 1950 & mdash; 80 years, when it was built in residential areas. The very first of these is Pershotravnevyi (Chokolivka), and the largest & mdash; Obolon and Vygurovschina-Troeschina.</p>
