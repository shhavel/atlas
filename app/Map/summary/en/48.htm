<p>On the African continent is 58 states and territories. In the past, almost all of them were colonies of European countries. In the 50-70-x's. The twentieth century. most countries of the continent became independent in 80-90-x's. Zimbabwe gained independence and Namibia. Remain dependent on. St. Helena (UK), about. Reunion (France), Ceuta and Melilla (Spain), Western Sahara (Morocco), on Mayotte (France). Most of the countries of the continent, becoming sovereign states were actually under the influence of its former parent.</p>
<p>The African continent has been and remains the least developed region of the world, called mainland backward, agrarian and raw material periphery of the world. All the states of the continent, except South Africa, belong to developing countries. For most of them characterized by economic and political instability, the narrow specialization of the economy, the low level of overall development, poverty and low life expectancy. 33 of the 47 least developed countries are in Africa. However, some countries of the continent due to the export of raw materials have managed to achieve a fairly high rate of GNP. Thus, in 90% of Libya's foreign trade income yield extraction and processing of oil; in Algeria are the leading oil and natural gas, phosphate rock and metal ores. Egypt's major exports are cotton and oil. For the production of cotton country ranks first in Africa, and for the production of high-quality long-staple cotton - first in the world. A special role in the economy of Egypt is playing outdoor in 1869, the Suez Canal, through which one of the most important sea routes from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, are significant government revenues from tourism. In the island Mauritius and Seychelles main source of income is tourism.</p>
<p>In other countries of the region is dominated by agriculture, which employs 60 to 80% of the working population. However, due to low productivity and the extensive nature of agriculture provides only 2/3 of local needs for food. In some countries, the development of export plantation areas with monocultural specialization. On exports of cocoa beans are allocated to Ghana, Ivory Coast and Nigeria, peanuts - Senegal, Niger and Gambia, palm oil - Nigeria, coffee - Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, vanilla - Madagascar, dates - Kenya, Tanzania.</p>
<p>Livestock production in the region has extensive character. The most developed animal husbandry (breeding buffaloes, mules, zebu), breeding of camels and sheep, whose products (except fur and leather) used for own needs of the population. Most of the animals used as draft power.</p>

<p>Saharan Africa - the most backward part of a group of developing countries. This is the least urbanized region in the world. North Africa - the more developed regions due to geographical location and availability of mineral resources.</p>
<p>South Africa - a country of resettlement of capitalism - was formed in 1910. The state is rich in minerals. Except for oil, natural gas and bauxite, it has all the minerals, which are exported to more than 80 countries. South Africa has a leading position in the world in reserves and production of gold, diamonds, magnesium, chromium and manganese ore, platinum group metals, asbestos, antimony, uranium ores. The share of manufacturing in GDP is 25%. In a country dominated by light industry, but significant and the share of metallurgy, mechanical engineering and metal working, chemical industry. Development of high technology industries - the military and the production of nuclear reactors. The main area of ​​the mining industry is the Witwatersrand - the main area of ​​production of gold and uranium. Here is the largest industrial center of the country - and the capital Johannesburg - Pretoria. In the same province, in the Kimberley region is mined diamonds. Transnational diamond mining group De Beers controls the diamond market in the world.</p>
