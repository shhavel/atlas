<p><b>Economy of Ukraine</b></p>
<p>Ukraine - is an industrial nation with a well-developed industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>In the cities of Ukraine to build industrial plants - plants and factories. Their placement depends on the raw materials they recycle, as well as consumers, which produces products of these enterprises. For operation of enterprises need fuel and electricity. Extraction of fuel (fossil fuels) do the fuel industry - coal, oil, gas, peat. Electricity is produced at power plants (nuclear, thermal, hydraulic, solar, wind). In hydropower to produce electric current using the energy of water, the heat - burning coal, oil, peat, natural gas and nuclear power to the energy source is nuclear fuel that is running the reactor.</p>
<p>Metallurgical industry includes plants where ores are smelted metals. Factories are being built, where there are deposits of iron ore and coal. Non-ferrous metals in Ukraine smelt aluminum, zinc, nickel, magnesium.</p>
<p>Engineering industry unites enterprises producing machines and equipment for other mills and factories. In Ukraine producing electric motors, turbines, coal combines, trucks and passenger cars, locomotives, ships, agricultural machines and equipment for chemical and light industry, and the airplanes of that world-famous "Ruslan" and "Dream."</p>
<p>In the chemical industry of mineral manufactures various products, such as: artificial fabrics, paints, plastics, rubber, pharmaceuticals, faux fur, alcohol.</p>
<p>Woodworking and paper industries producing furniture, various building materials, paper and cardboard.</p>
<p>In the food industry, processing of livestock and crop production, producing, cereals, flour, canned goods, sugar, starch, oil, sweets, meat and dairy products. And in light industry factories sewing clothes, shoes, make toys and more.</p>
<p>All industries are interconnected and depend on natural resources, transport network and the end user.</p>
<p>Agriculture of Ukraine is also well developed, and in some positions (production of sunflower and sunflower oil, sugar, potatoes, cereals), our state - among the world leaders.</p>
<p>Crop production - a growing crop plants. Plants, like people, react differently to environmental conditions. Therefore, in each natural area cultivated certain plants that are best perceived climatic conditions of a particular area. Ukraine has mostly grown for grain and industrial plants as well as vegetables and fruits.</p>
<p>Corn plants - this herbaceous plants that have roots growing bunch, stem blank - straw, leaves are long and narrow, fruit - grains.</p>
<p>Main cereal plants grown in Ukraine - winter and spring wheat. The best crops of wheat give black earth steppe and steppe. Winter rye well to bear in northern Ukraine. By the spring unpretentious grain plants owned by barley and oats. Corn gives high yields only in fairly moist black soil. Rice is grown on irrigated lands of southern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Crop plants that process in factories called technical. Among them - potatoes, sugar beets, flax, requiring a lot of moisture, and light and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Sunflower grows best on fertile black soil that is well heated. Also on fields of Ukraine cultivated buckwheat, peas, soybeans, millet.</p>
<p>Vegetables are grown on soils of fields, gardens, greenhouses, rich in nutrients and moisture. Across the country, growing onions, garlic, carrots, cabbage, cucumbers, tomatoes.</p>
<p>Ukraine is famous for its fruit trees and bushes, apple, pear, cherry, plum, currants, gooseberries, raspberries. In Crimea and Transcarpathia well grow peaches and grapes.</p>
<p>Growing of cereals and industrial plants, vegetable gardening - a crop. With wheat and rye flour baked bread; Grains of oats, barley, rice, corn grits produce. With potato and corn starch manufacture; of sunflower and corn - oil; from beet - sugar; from the stalks of flax - tissue.</p>
<p>Another large branch of agriculture is livestock, which provides us food to eat, and animals used for other purposes (such as draft power, for example).</p>
<p>Farm animals provide milk, meat, fat, eggs, honey, feathers, wool, fur.</p>
<p>Everywhere in rural Ukraine bred cows that are engaged in animal husbandry. From spring to autumn the cows graze in pastures. Summer to prepare them hay and silage. Winter in the diet adds milled grain, beets, pumpkins. Common is in a rural pig farm. Usually they are built where there is food for pigs - beets, potatoes, barley, pumpkins and corn. In the Carpathians, in the valleys graze sheep.</p>
<p>Poultry: chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys grow and keep on poultry farms.</p>
<p>Poultry common in the steppe zone, where they grow crops - the main feed for poultry.</p>
<p>Bees are raised in areas where honey plants in bloom. Beekeeping provides valuable products - honey, wax, propolis.</p>
<p>Fisheries engaged in fish farming in natural and artificial reservoirs.</p>
<p>Some farms involved in breeding horses for transportation of goods, tillage and other sports.</p>
