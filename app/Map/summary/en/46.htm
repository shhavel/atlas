Their economies are closely integrated.</p>
<p>USA - highly postindustrial countries. Almost 70% of workers are employed in the non-manufacturing sector. The US accounts for a quarter of the world's industrial production. Of particular importance are the latest high-tech production: exact and transport machinery, chemical industry, ferrous metallurgy, electric power. Traditionally an important role to play continue textile and food industries.</p>
<p>USDA - highly intensive and diversified. It satisfies the internal needs of the country's food and raw materials, and provides a significant portion of export earnings. The main link agriculture are farm, which are characterized by a high level of technical and scientific support and, as a result, high productivity.</p>
<p>As the country is a clear zonal specialization of agriculture. Here are the following agricultural zones:</p>
<p></p>
<p>· Wheat - from Canada to Texas;</p>
<p></p>
<p>· Corn - Central Valley;</p>
<p></p>
<p>· Hlopchatnikovy - the valley of the Mississippi River;</p>
<p></p>
<p>· Milk - Lakeshire States;</p>
<p></p>
<p>· Belt grazing beef cattle breeding - mountain states of the West;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The largest area of ​​vegetable growing and gardening is California, which provides half the world's third collection of lemons and oranges. On the central plains of cultivated soybean and sunflower, Florida and Hawaii - sugar cane, on the Atlantic Coastal Coast - tobacco, peanuts, and cotton.</p>
<p>In the territorial structure of the USA can be traced some differences. The northern part of the country (industrial North) produces more than half the various industrial and agricultural products. The largest centers - Chicago, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia. Here are concentrated almost half the country's population (Atlantic Coastal mega-cities Northeast megalopolis - 50 million people and Lakeside Chipits - 35 million).</p>
<p>South specializes in the mining, chemical and textile industries, as well as some areas of agriculture. Gulf Coast formed the world's largest oil and gas industry (Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma).</p>
<p>The western part of the area is of a later development, but the pace of development is ahead of the others. It is dominated by mining, forestry, sheep and tourism. Los Angeles called the airline raketokosmicheskoy capital, also here is the center of the film industry Hollywood. Las Vegas - the center of gambling and entertainment. From San Francisco to San Diego, California megalopolis stretches of San San, with a population of 25 million people.</p>
<p>Modern American economy characterized by a high concentration of production and capital. The biggest US companies, by their nature, are transnational (General Motors, General Electric, Boeing, ІVM, Microsoft, and others). The State shall promote the development of new high-tech industries, funds promising research, particularly in the military-industrial complex and the adjacent areas.</p>
<p>Canada occupies the northern part of the continent. By area, the country is second only to Russia.

On the world market, Canada is exporting mineral and forest resources, and certain agricultural products. Almost 3/4 of Canadian exports go to the US.</p>
<p>Accommodation economy characterized by high spatial concentration in the south, to a lesser extent - in the central provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Here are concentrated all the manufacturing industries and areas of mineral extraction. The largest industrial centers - Montreal, Toronto. Northern Territory are in the development stage. In areas with extreme conditions of life are mined some minerals and common traditional occupations of the local population (marine mammals, fishing, hunting deer and fur animals). Prairie provinces (Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta) is a major agricultural area. They specialize in grain farming, beef cattle, sheep. Canada also grows sugar beets, wheat and barley exports.</p>
