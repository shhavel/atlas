<p>The flora of Ukraine is varied species composition. From 300-350 thousand. Higher plant species of the planet, Ukraine has 25 thousand. It's several dozen species of trees, hundreds of species of shrubs, nearly a thousand species of annual grasses. Of particular importance are endemic, rare and endangered plant species (over 1000) that are listed in the Red Data Book of Ukraine. The natural vegetation is preserved only 25% of Ukraine. Economic activity of the population has led to significant changes in vegetation, especially in the forest-steppe and steppe zones where land is actively used as farmland.</p>
<p>The map shows the vegetation types of plant communities that are isolated within Ukraine, forests, steppes, meadows and marshes. On the plains observed latitudinal zonation from north to south: mixed oak and pine woods - oak - meadow steppes - herb-fescue-feather grass steppes - grass-wormwood steppes. In the mountains, plant communities change with height (altitude explain). Yes, foothill steppe forests varies - from deciduous to coniferous who go into higher subalpine zone valleys (the Carpathians), and jajl (in Crimean mountains).</p>
