<p>It lies in the west of Ukraine. The peculiarities of the terrain is divided into three parts: the plains, foothills and mountains. The northern part - within Podolsk Upland (300 m) and Khotyn Upland (G. Baird, 515 m). Surface - enhanced Lesova undulating and hilly-ridged plains, dissected by canyon river valleys, ravines and gullies. In the west there are karst landforms (Zastavnivsky karst plain). In the south - Pryprutska terraced plains. Sub-Rod - increased gently undulating plain changes in foothill hill (500 m), terraced valleys dissected into separate ridged-hilly areas. About 25% of the area occupied by Pokutsko-Bukovina Carpathians. The central part of the mountains takes Putilsky-Verhovinsky lowland, mid - middle ranges of the massive karst rel'yefu. The area is rich in various minerals, including a lot of building materials: limestone, marl, quartz and glauconite sand, loam, clay and bentonite brick and tile, red-brown and gray sandstone, marble. In Transnistria - gypsum, phosphates, Celestine. In the Carpathians - ore minerals: manganese, Polymetal, with non-metallic minerals - graphite, bituminous shale, lignite; are manifestations of the oil and gas content. Many mineral springs are mud. The climate is continental, mild and humid; in the mountains - a longer winter, snow, summer humid, cool. Temperature in January is -6 °, -10 °, July - + 13 °, + 16 °, under the plain -4,8 °, -5 °; + 18,8 °, + 19,5 °, in the foothills of -4,8 °, -5,5 °; + 16,2 °, + 19 °. Annual precipitation increases from the plains to the mountains: from 500-600 mm in the plains and 700 mm in the foothills and 800-1 200 mm in the mountains. In the 75 river length of 10 km each. They belong to the basins of the Danube River (Prut tributaries Cheremos, White Cheremos, Siret with Suchava) and the Dniester. Right tributary of the Dniester small. The region is part of the Dniester reservoir (the area within the region of 142 sq. Km), constructed many small reservoirs and about 600 ponds. The soil varies with altitude: the plain - gray forest and dark gray ashed soils ashed in river valleys - sod-meadow chernozem and meadow. In the foothills dominate sod-podzolic gley surface at the foot of the mountains - brownsoil-podzolic gley much. In the mountains - brown forest on low mountains and valleys - turf brownsoil in the valleys - turf and meadow soils. Forests cover 32% of the area. On the Prut-Dniester interfluve - beech, beech-oak forests east - oak-hornbeam. In Mesopotamia in the foothills - Solid beech and beech-fir forests. In the mountains - high-altitude zones: 800 - 900 m - beech and beech-fir, 950 - 1100 m - spruce-fir, 1 100 - 1 400 m - fir, above - subalpine grasslands (meadows). The fauna includes 359 species, including mammals - 70 birds - 205 species of reptiles - 12 fish - 56 Modern adverse natural processes - erosion, landslides, karst, waterlogging, erosion shores of the Dniester reservoir; in the mountains - linear and planar erosion washout, landslides, avalanches and placers, village, windfalls and fallen trees, karst. Reclamation: environmental protection, afforestation of eroded gullies and slopes, plantations of trees.</p>
