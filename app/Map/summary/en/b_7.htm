<p>As can be seen from the map, world population is located extremely uneven. Illustrates the figure population density - the ratio of the population of a given territory to its area (people per km sq.). Also on the map filed the largest city and metropolitan area of ​​the planet.</p>
<p>In the world about 15% of the land is still not settled, about half of the reclaimed areas with a population density of less than 5 per. / Km sq., And there are those where the rate reaches 1000 or more people. / Km sq.</p>
<p>Accommodation has always depended on the environment (topography, climate). Thus, 80% of humanity living on the plains, which cover less than a third of the Earth's land. The most convenient for habitation and economic activity is moderate and subtropical climate zones because they are more populous. On the distribution of the population is also influenced by historical, socio-economic, demographic and other factors. Thus, the most populated regions of the world include the territory of ancient agriculture (North China plain, Indo-Ґanґska lowland valley of the Nile, Japanese islands, about. Java) and staropromyslovi areas of Europe and eastern North America. Much the same population density coasts of North America, Africa, Australia connected with the history of the development of these areas.</p>
<p>Schedule Population Dynamics of the Earth in the past and forecast the future is an illustration of the so-called population explosion - rapid population growth. Getting Boomers, as seen from the graph falls on the eighteenth - XIX centuries. This period of the industrial revolution in Western Europe. In the twentieth century. after the collapse of the colonial empires in 50-60 years. The highest population growth rates observed in developing countries, this trend continues today. According to the UN projections to the end of the century the population of the planet could reach 10 billion people.</p>
