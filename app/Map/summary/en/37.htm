<p>With the purpose of nature protection measures are carried out:</p>
<p>the creation of protected areas;</p>
<p>regulation of the use of natural resources;</p>
<p>protection of the natural environment (water protection measures, land reclamation, regulation of surface runoff, reducing the volume of waste water and purification, etc.);</p>
<p>independent environmental assessment of projects and assessment of the impact of economic activity on the environment;</p>
<p>monitoring the state of the natural environment (from regional to global monitoring of the biosphere).</p>
<p>This map gives an idea of ​​some of the protected areas of the countries of the world (relative to the total area of ​​the country). Protected areas, depending on the purpose, features of the protection regime and sizes are divided into reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserves, cultural monuments and other protected areas. The total area of ​​protected areas in the world is more than 5% of the land surface. The most common in the world are the national parks, nature reserves and reservations.</p>
<p>Reserves - a land or water areas, all derived from the economic use; their main purpose - to serve as models of nature.</p>
<p>Reserves - a territory, which for some years in certain seasons or year-round protected by certain types of animal, plant or part of the natural complex.</p>
<p>National Parks - the most common form of protected areas, which are characterized by a massive admission of visitors.</p>
<p>To the greatest area of ​​environmental protection facilities of the world are Greenland National Park (7 million hectares), the Central Kalahari Reserve in Botswana (Africa 5.3 million hectares), Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia, the National Park Great Victoria Desert in Australia and others.</p>
<p>In developing countries, the proportion of protected areas is somewhat less than in developed, but it is growing, because national parks are quite profitable. Nevertheless, the creation of national parks in Africa, Asia and Latin America need inhibited migration of nomadic tribes and the possibility of reducing the areas of their business activities (hunting, farming). During the armed conflict in national parks are often the scene of clashes belligerents. And for poachers these areas are often the destination of illegal fishing. In the world operates many international conservation organizations. Among them, one of the most famous - the World Wildlife Fund. The Fund operates in more than 90 countries and affects environmental policy states that support the implementation of environmental programs.</p>
