<p>With maps can be traced zonal distribution pattern of soil. In northern Ukraine, dominated by sod-podzolic soils (including gley, formed under waterlogged conditions) to the west in the plains - gray forest soils and ashed black, further to the east - a set of typical forest soils and chernozems rehradovanymy that alternate with soils that formed under forest vegetation (ashed). South of the forest-steppe zone of soil complexes very clearly distinguished varieties desert soil complexes that define its boundaries pidzonalni: ordinary black - northern steppe, Southern black - medium plain, brown soils - southern steppe. Some large complexes of soils associated with mountain regions of the Carpathians (brownsoil-podzolic, brown mountain-forest and sod-brownsoil and mountain-meadow soils that formed under near mountain forests and meadows) and Crimea (brown mountain-forest and sod-brownsoil and mountain-meadow, mountain brown soils).</p>
<p>The formation of soil - a complex potses lasting hundreds or thousands of years. Modern soils Ukraine formed in post-glacial times.</p>
<p>Most closely associated with ground cover of natural vegetation. Soil fertility affects the productivity of natural and cultural vegetation. Soils Ukraine undergo significant changes under the influence of economic activity, deteriorating soil structure and reduces fertility. Due to excessive irrigation salinity and waterlogging occurs soils. Under the action of herbicides drastically reduces the number of microorganisms in the soil.</p>
