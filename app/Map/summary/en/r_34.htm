<p>Yevraziya- largest continent of the planet. Its constituents are two of the world: Europe and Asia. The area of ​​the continent, together with the islands is about 54 600 thousand in km. Sq. The mainland is relative to the equator in the Northern Hemisphere, some islands in the south-east of it are in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Mainland washed four oceans in the west - the Atlantic in the north - the Arctic, from the east - the Pacific, from the south - Indian. In fact, the entire length of the mainland coastline indented by numerous bays and seas. The greatest number of islands girt northern, eastern and south-eastern part of Eurasia.</p>
<p>Rivers dismembered already heterogeneous surface height mainland. The largest among the rivers - the Danube, Volga, Ob, Yenysey, Lena, Amur, Yangtze Mekonґ.</p>
<p>Compared with other continents Eurasia marked predominance of mountains, its average height is 840 m. The mountains were formed in different geological epochs. Due to strong tectonic activity in the Neogene-Antropogene was Rejuvenation (raising) the ancient mountain ranges and the formation of new alpine folded structures. The continent is the highest mountain system is the planet's highest peak of the Himalayas and the Earth - G. Dzhomolunґma.</p>
<p>From horotvorchi processes associated formation of intermontane basins in Central Asia, near Lake Baikal and the Dead Sea, which has the lowest rate in the world (- 408 m).</p>
<p>Young fold structures and structures restored mountains inherent phenomenon of seismicity (earthquakes) and volcanism. In Eurasia, are extinct volcanoes in the Caucasus, the Carpathians, Alborz and operating the Apennine peninsula on the island. Sicily and more.</p>
<p>For highlands Eurasia typical mountain glaciers in the Pamirs, Tien Shan, the Hindu Kush, Kunlun, Tibet and Ґimalayah as well as in the Alps and the Scandinavian mountains. Remains pokrivnoho icing is on the islands of the Arctic Ocean (Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya).</p>
<p>Large areas of the mainland territory is occupied by wetlands - marshes (north and west of the East European Plain, West Siberian Plain, the lower reaches of the Lena and Kolyma, and the islands of south-east) and areas with insufficient moisture - the desert. The biggest in the desert - Kyzyl Kum in Central Asia, the Rub al Khali in the Arabian Peninsula, the Gobi and Taklamakan in Central Asia. Is the continent and salt lakes (Balkhash) and saline territory on the Iranian plateau and the Gobi Desert to the north.</p>
<p>In the warm southern seas conditions favor the development of corals that form reefs, numerous. Instead, the seas of the Arctic Ocean covered by ice in the summer and winter floating ice streams submitted to the Japanese islands.</p>
