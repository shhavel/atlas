<p>Differences climate in different parts of the globe caused by three main factors: latitude areas, the movement of air masses and the nature pidstelyayuchoyi surface.</p>
<p>From June to August sun illuminates over the Northern Hemisphere. June 22 the angle of sunlight on the parallel 23 ° 30 'North. w. is 90 °. It was then observed in the Northern Hemisphere the longest day and shortest night because June 22 is called the day of the summer solstice. In the parallel 66 ° 30 'North. w. During this period the sun never sets on the horizon, although the angle of sunlight is small, there polar day. The parallel of 23 ° 30 'North. w. called the Northern Tropic, and the parallel 66 ° 30 'North. w. - Arctic Circle. This time of year in the Southern Hemisphere winter. To the south of the parallel of 66 ° 30 'South. w. (South of the Arctic Circle) the sun does not appear at all. There polar night.</p>
<p>Thus the line of the tropics on the map limit area within which the sun twice a year is at its zenith (90 ° to the surface). Polar circles show the latitude, which are polar day and polar night.</p>
<p>In between the solstices, namely 21 March and 23 September the Earth occupies a position relative to the sun when the sun's rays illuminate the same southern and northern hemisphere. All over the world, except the poles, day is night. These days are called the days of the equinoxes (spring and autumn, respectively).</p>
<p>If the climate is dependent only on the angle of incidence of sunlight, then at the same latitude as the temperature would be the same. But because the ocean warms and cools more slowly than land, ocean and continental air masses also have different temperatures. There is a pressure difference, resulting in a huge air masses moving, carrying a supply of moisture. Moving from the oceans inland continental climate becomes drier as wet as rain falls mainly in coastal areas. However, climate map, you can find places in the world where almost no rain and the ocean. This is mainly due to the passage of near cold currents. Chilled over such poor air flow for moisture and does not form clouds. That is why the oceans were formed on the coast of the Atacama Desert in South America and Namibia in Africa.</p>
<p>The climate of warm winters, cool summers, low amplitude vibrations annual air temperatures and high rainfall are called sea. Climate with cold winters and hot summers and relatively low rainfall is considered to be continental. There is moderate continental, continental and rizkokontynentalnyy climate. The climate of the vast majority of the territory of Ukraine is temperate continental. The climate of the coastal areas that are under the influence of monsoon, monsoon called.</p>
<p>Average temperature and rainfall on the continents substantially violate not only the cold ocean currents. Warm air currents warm coast. Yes, the North Atlantic current, such as warming the shores of the Scandinavian Peninsula, creates conditions for the growth of mixed forests, while in Greenland at the same latitude formed bahatokilometrova thickness of the ice. Significantly affect the climate and topography of land. Mountain ranges delay air masses, contributing to the rainfall. That is why in the foothills of the Himalayas in India, the largest falls on the Earth rainfall, nearly 12 000 mm per year, and on the western slopes of the Carpathians account for more rain than the east. The mountains also protect from cold winds. Therefore, on the southern coast of Crimea practically no frost. Plain contrary - let air mass for thousands of kilometers, which is why the northern wind always comes to us cooling.</p>
<p>As the air temperature in the troposphere decreases with altitude, the altitude above sea level also affects the climate. From the height it becomes colder. That is why the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, near the equator year round snow.</p>
