<p>Power is part of the fuel and energy complex (FEC) and plays an important role in the economy of Ukraine. The components of the electricity is power, teploenerhotsentrali, power supply facilities.</p>
<p>The lion's share of electricity generated at nuclear power plants and thermal power plants (47% in 2006). Hydroelectric power production is provided by at least 7% of Ukrainian electricity.</p>
<p>TES operating on different fuels (coal, gas, oil, etc.), so natural is the placement of TPS and TPP (a producer of heat) near raw material bases and consumers. Working TPP and TPP quite polluting, because their concentration near major metropolitan areas is a serious problem. On the other hand, the distance of stations to consumers of energy raises the problem of higher prices due to transportation costs.</p>
<p>Developed in Ukraine have nuclear power. The total capacity of Ukrainian nuclear power plants increased significantly with the commissioning of two new units at Rivne and Khmelnitsky stations. Industry requires significant funds for reconstruction and safe operation. Although normally working nuclear power plant polluting far less than the TPP, though nuclear power plants are a source of danger. For example, some states after the accident abandoned nuclear power in general. Besides, the NPP spent fuel must zahoronyuvaty in special circumstances, which in Ukraine. Because disposal is carried out in, that our state pays heavily.</p>
<p>Most hydropower plants built on the Dnieper, but the energy of the largest rivers in Ukraine are fully used, because hydropower development in Ukraine has great potential. In addition, the construction of hydroelectric dam construction needs, forming reservoirs, rivers and change the mode flood large areas. Recently was put into operation first Tashlytska storage plant. This station is built on the poor in energy resources the Southern Bug River, so it works on a cyclical schedule. At night, when not working, most industrial users of electricity in the reservoir water station dialed. At the time of maximum peak loads on the grid accumulated water is discharged per night and turns the turbine produces electricity to meet the needs of industry.</p>
<p>Increasingly become popular in Ukraine solar, wind, geothermal plant, but so far their share of produced energy is negligible.</p>
<p>In general, Ukraine is both exporters and importers of electricity from a small surplus. Map makes it possible to trace the direction of electricity export. The largest domestic consumers of electricity are industry (65%), transport and agriculture (10%), construction. So, naturally, that the largest power generation capacity are concentrated in industrial regions.</p>
<p>Significant pollution problems with transporting electricity and lack of fuel stations to encourage the search for unconventional sources of energy production.</p>
