<p>For the image area on the plan applicable scale. Scale - a reduction in the degree of real objects. For example, a model airplane is made in scale 1: 100 would be 100 times smaller than the aircraft itself. The scope of the plan or map shows how many times the distance on the plan or map will be less than the corresponding distance on the ground.</p>
<p>Typically, the scale point under the lower border plan or map. The same scale can be expressed in different ways. Numeric (or numerical) called out, served as a fractional number, the numerator of which is one and the denominator - the number that indicates how many times the reduced image. For example, the map scale 1:10 000 topography reduced all 10 000 times, ie 1 cm on the map corresponds to 10,000 inches on the ground. Distance on the ground is usually expressed in meters or kilometers, so convenient to say that this map 1 cm to 100 m. It is for the convenience of the cards, in addition to numerical, sign also called scale - a verbal explanation of how many meters or kilometers area corresponds 1cm plan or map. To place a numerical scale in the denominator referred to as necessary to reduce the numerical scale (cross out a few zeros). Therefore, if we want the words to explain how many meters area contains 1 cm maps, the denominator numerical scale are reducing by 100 (2 crosses zero), if the distance on the ground is expressed in km, then the denominator numerical scale reducing 10 000 (cross out of 5 zeros). For example: 1:25 000 (1 cm to 250 m), 1: 100 000 (1 cm to 1 km), 1: 3 000 000 (1 cm 30 km). To simplify the measurement of distances on the map is sometimes used linear scale. He is a straight line, divided into equal parts, usually centimeters. One or two of a point to the left of zero are divided into smaller for more accurate results. Graduations digitizes according to scale. To determine the distance using a compass, measure, putting his feet first into the parts required section of the map, and then to a linear scale.</p>
<p>The more we apply the reduction in the image area, the greater the plot area, but with less detail can be visualized. In other words, the larger the denominator of the scale, the smaller objects appear on the map. Plans and maps, which show the small areas usually are large. According to the classification established to include large-scale plans and maps, which corresponds to 1 cm to 2 km area (up to 1: 200 000). Cards, 1 cm which contains from 2 to 10 km area (up to 1: 1000 000), referred to as Medium-Sized. A map on which 1 cm contains more than 10 km area, called by small, for example, a map of the hemispheres scale 1:90 000 000 (1 cm 900 km), Ukraine map scale 1: 3 500 000 (1 cm 35 km) .</p>
