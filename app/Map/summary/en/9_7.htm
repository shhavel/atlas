<p>12 (24) June 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia. His army, numbering 640 thousand. People. and 1372 guns directed their main attack on Moscow. She resisted the Russian army of 597 thousand. People. But it was divided into three parts: first, headed by General Barclay de Tolly, defended the way to St. Petersburg, II-A, headed by General Bagration, defended the way to Moscow, III-I, headed by General Tormasov defended way to Kyiv. The Russian command had chosen a strategic plan that called for the gradual depletion of enemy small skirmishes and stretching its communications, not engaging in a decisive battle.</p>
<p>In its plan, Napoleon gave Ukraine an important place, which he planned to turn in cell anti-Russian movement. Right bank, he promised to return the King of Poland, Galicia and Volyn - pass the Austrian emperor, Crimea, on the Black Sea - the Turkish Sultan. The rest of the territory was divided into military and colonial administrative region (napoleonidy) and become a source of supply of the French army food, fodder, horses, oxen, and even soldiers.</p>
<p>In order to prevent anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, Alexander I issued a manifesto urging Ukrainian people to defend their land. By Cossack regiments and militia came almost 70 thousand. People. Before troops entered the free peasant population of serfs. In the formation of one Cossack regiment participated outstanding Ukrainian poet and writer Ivan Kotliarevsky. In the regular Russian army Ukrainian accounted for a significant percentage. Thus, among the ranks of it amounted to 50% among junior officers - 80% of senior officers - 20%. Among the Ukrainian population, there are two views on the war. First - look autonomists, who hoped to help Napoleon to gain autonomy. The second - "Little-conservatives" that tended to Alexander I and hoped after defeating Napoleon's army again raise the question of autonomy. Therefore Ukrainian people donated to the military large sums of money, lots of food, feed, oxen, horses, means of transportation, took an active part in the construction of defenses. On the Ukrainian militia spent 9 mln. Rubles., 13.5 pounds of silver and a few pounds of gold.</p>
<p>Quite well prepared to repel the enemy attack Kyiv. Around the city built a new building, have done much to further the restructuring and strengthening of Pechersk fortress.</p>
<p>Specially designed to capture Kyiv Corps Schwarzenberg Napoleon's troops did not manage to break even in Ukraine. Fighting covered only part of Volyn.</p>
<p>In fighting against Napoleon's army took part 2 bug 2 3 Kiev Poltava and Cossack regiments, a squadron of Kherson Cossack troops "forest Cossacks" a great mix of Ukrainian and Don Cossacks. Especially glorified herself Ukrainian militia in Poland during the siege and capture of the fortress of Zamosc.</p>
<p>Selfless patriotism shown even single soldiers who for various reasons found themselves behind enemy lines. With the local population, they organized guerrilla groups who were harassing the invaders (F. Potapov, E. Chetvertak).</p>
<p>Eight Ukrainian Cossack regiments participated in the so-called "Battle of the Nations" in autumn 1813 at Leipzig. It was another crushing defeat of Napoleon's army caused her coalition troops, Britain, Austria, Prussia, Saxony, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal. The winners opened a direct way to Paris. In March 1814, six Ukrainian Cossack regiments in the Russian army entered the capital of France. So the war was over. However, Ukrainian aspirations that their situation will improve after the war, were in vain.</p>
<p>By decree of the Emperor all the Cossack regiments and militia was disbanded. Most militia returned to serf status, and for their service each received two rubles compensation.</p>
<p>As the emperor renounced his promises of the Little Russian Cossacks Cossack cavalry regiments who wanted to perform military service, was forced to leave the Kuban Cossack Army to the Black Sea. Others have returned to their homes, because most of them were fairly wealthy and belonged to the state peasants.</p>
<p>Formed mainly on the right bank of the serfs, Ukrainian Cossack cavalry division with regiments Buh Cossacks became the object of cruel social experiment, carried out the tsarist government. In order to reduce spending on the military emperor, at the suggestion of his friend O.Arakcheyeva, issued a decree on the organization of military settlements, where military service is combined with agricultural labor. In Ukraine military settlement was organized in Sloboda-Ukrainian, Ekaterinoslavskoy, Kiev and Kherson provinces. Severe palochni living conditions in these settlements eventually led to a wave of uprisings.</p>
<p>This can be said to Alexander and formally kept his word and did not return to serfdom Cossacks, but the situation of military settlers were even worse than serfs.</p>
<p>All life settlers from morning till night regulated military ordinance. Numerous regulations and guidelines define privacy in a family and raise children, the order in the house and so on. Frequent unannounced inspections at any time, houses, military parades were not given opportunities to farm and made their lives worse than prison. That was thanks to Alexander and valiant Ukrainian Cossacks - rescuers his empire.</p>

<p>Relations between the Russian and Ottoman empires again accelerated in the 20's. XIX c., As the first insisted on its right to act as protector of all Orthodox subjects of the Sultan. Russia's support of the liberation of the Greek uprising against the Turks led to the beginning of another war. Like the previous war, the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829. Lay a burden on Ukrainian land. Again, peasants were required to supply the Russian army food and feed provide oxen and carts to transport goods.</p>
<p>The Russian army has been weakened by experiments O.Arakcheyeva with the creation of military settlements and did not have the necessary powers to conduct a long war. In this difficult situation, Emperor Nicholas I, like its predecessor, made mention of Cossacks. In 1828 was founded Danube Cossack Host in Southern Bessarabia, where for two decades settled Danubian Cossack returning from Turkey to Ukraine. Danube army was one of the most capable part of the Russian army.</p>
<p>Unexpected aid received during the war, the Russian army and the Cossacks zadunaytsiv who led by chieftain Joseph Gladkyy linked directly to the side of. In response, Turkey has destroyed the Danubian Sich.</p>
<p>As a result of successful action war was quickly over. Turkey was defeated and was forced by the Adrianople treaty in 1829 to give mouth of the Danube and the eastern coast of the Black Sea. Ukrainians again, once again, helped the Empire to realize its geopolitical interests.</p>
