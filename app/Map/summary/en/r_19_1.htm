<p>Antarctica - a southern polar region of the planet, including Antarctica continent and the surrounding islands and the sea.</p>
<p>For more than 200 years, this rough country attracts travelers and researchers. James Cook traveled pivdennopolyarnymy seas in 1774, met on his way only the accumulation of sea ice. Not seeing land, the great explorer categorically stated that the southern continent exists. Then, almost half a century, no one tried to restore the search.</p>
<p>After considerable success in promoting the expedition to Antarctica reached England William Smith and Edward Brendsvilda. And the Russians are considered pioneers of the continent Thaddeus Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev, whose expedition of 1820 proved the existence of the continent, defined its boundaries and the climate.</p>
<p>The next seventy years studied the mainland from the sea - too harsh and seemed impregnable its shores. Only in 1895, the Norwegians L. Christensen and K. Borhhrevinkom was initiated a new phase of research mainland Antarctica - these brave men were on the coast of the continent and gathered the first collection poor Antarctic flora. In XX century the study of Antarctica became regular - Britain, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Australia, Japan sent its own expedition there.</p>
<p>Conquest of the South Pole took place in December 1911 Norwegian Roald Amundsen, who a month ahead of its rival the Englishman Robert Scott.</p>
<p>Antarctica - the continent in the Southern Hemisphere, lies around south geographic pole. Area of ​​ice shelves and islands among them - 14 100 thousand. Km square.</p>
<p>Antarctica is washed by three oceans: Indian, Atlantic, Pacific. Inland seas of Antarctica course not, because 99% of its territory is covered by glaciers. Ice volume reached 24.9 million cubic km. - More than 80% of the planet's fresh water.</p>
<p>Antarctica - the highest continent on the planet. Ice cover formed here about 20 million years ago, in some places reaches a height of 4800 m. The presence of ice cover identifies unusual topography, formed of two layers - the lower and upper Indigenous ice.</p>
<p>The height of the continent through the ice sheet is over 2000 m (the highest among other continents), but the bulk of the plains of eastern Antarctica slipped under the ice and below sea level. The western part belted ranges, one of which is crowned by an active volcano Erebus. Because of the continent stretching Transantarctic Mountains. The highest point of the continent is on the Vinson Massif (5140 m). Antarctica Glaciers are constantly moving. At the edges of the continent vidkolyuyetsya ice to form icebergs.</p>
<p>In Antarctica, found many minerals (coal, iron ore, chromium, nickel, gold). But given the severity of the climate and the threat of disruption of the ecological balance of this unique region of the world mining declared unprofitable and unnecessary.</p>
