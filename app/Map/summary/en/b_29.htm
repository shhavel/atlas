<p>The chemical industry as one of the three branches of the avant-garde is very dynamic in its development and science-intensive. Twentieth century is called the century of chemicals - so big in this period was the use of chemical materials and technologies in all spheres of the economy and everyday life. This production of cheap and various synthetic materials (plastics, Photopolymer, chemical fiber, rubber, organic glass, film, etc.) and basic chemical products (fertilizers, acids, soda, detergents, etc.). The development of the chemical industry provides additional opportunities to develop new technologies for waste disposal many economic sectors.</p>
<p>Raw materials sector is wide and varied. In addition to mineral raw chemicals industry uses all kinds of fuel resources (especially oil and gas), wood, water, air, and industrial wastes. The chemical industry is best represented in the developed countries, where they formed the major areas of the industry, with a wide range of products. The European region produces 40% of the industry. The leading countries are Germany (kontsernBASFye largest chemical producers in the world), France, Great Britain, Italy, specializing in the production of new knowledge-intensive products. The second region is North America, which is almost equal to the value of Europe. United States is the world leading countries in the production of polymers, fertilizers and so on. The third region is the East and South-East Asia, which is a powerful center of Japan. It is the leading petrochemicals, working on oil is imported. Rapidly developing chemical industry in China (specialized in manufacturing of fertilizers and petrochemicals). The fourth region formed in Eastern Europe on the basis of significant raw material and energy resources. High level of chemical industry also differs Australia.</p>
<p>Among developing countries, the chemical industry is growing especially where there is a significant excess oil and natural gas (Venezuela, Indonesia, the Persian Gulf). Elsewhere extract certain types of mining and chemical raw materials.</p>
