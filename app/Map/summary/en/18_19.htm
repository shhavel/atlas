<p>361 million square meters. km, or 71% of the globe is covered by water. The solid Earth forms a water shell oceans. The volume of water in the oceans is 1 billion 338 million cubic kilometers, the average depth is 3795 m and the maximum reaches 11 022 m (Marianas Trench). Depending on the structure of the bottom contours shores of continents, the properties of water masses in the oceans emit some oceans, seas, bays, straits. The oceans form the largest part of the oceans. The boundaries of the oceans are continents, and in southern latitudes - the line meridians drawn from the extreme points of the continents to Antarctica. The largest of the oceans are the Pacific, which occupies one third of the globe. The waters of the South Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans by natural properties differ significantly from the northern waters. Therefore, in recent years, scientists and hydrologists and oceanographers isolated pryantarktychni water masses in a separate Southern Ocean. Similar to the properties of water is the smallest ocean - the Arctic.</p>
<p>Sea called partial ocean that goes deep into the land, or isolated islands and peninsulas. There are sea: marginal, who had resorted to the land; Mediterranean, located in the continent, or between continents and oceans are connected to one or more channels, and inter-island sea. Gulf call of the ocean or sea which juts out into the deep dry, but has a broad relationship with the ocean. Strait - a relatively narrow part of the body of water that connects two adjacent water area and separates areas of land.</p>
<p>The surface of the oceans is never quiet.</p>
<p>Under the influence of wind waves occur that usually have a height of several meters, but in some cases, very high winds, the height of ocean waves can reach tens of meters. The water is almost not moving horizontally. There have only vertical vibrations. Only under constant winds, the water masses are able to move horizontally, forming a wind flow. Currents move large masses of water from one area to the other oceans, causing water mass properties offering may differ from the surrounding waters. There are cold and warm currents. However, this concept is relative. If the water temperature in the flow of warmer water for the surrounding ocean, such a flow is a warm water if it is colder - cold. That's why the water in the warm currents may have a lower temperature than in cold. For example, in July the water warm North Atlantic current with temperature + 8 ° C, and the cold water currents Benґelskoyi warmed to 20 ° C.</p>
<p>The waves can occur not only by the wind, and as a result of underwater earthquakes (moretrusiv). Such waves are called tsunamis. They can reach gigantic size (30-35 m), and move at a speed of 700-800 km per hour. Nakochuyuchys ashore tsunami causing catastrophic damage. Most tsunamis occur on the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>As you know, all planetary bodies with gravitational force that attracts them to each other. Gravitational forces of our "cosmic neighborhood" - the moon and the sun, draw water, oceans, causing periodic fluctuations in water levels ebb and flow. These changes in water level occur every 6 hours. They depend not only on the relative placement of the Earth, moon and sun, but also on the geographical latitude, the depth of the sea, forms the coastline. In some places the height of the tidal reaches 18 m (Bay of Fundy Atlantic Ocean), while in the open ocean tide height not exceeding 0.5 meters.</p>
<p>Because the river water containing dissolved salt water oceans are salty. Ocean salinity slowly increases as the water evaporates and the salt remains in the ocean, dropping the sediment and accumulate. Water salinity is measured in ppm - thousandth share value. Thus, the salinity in parts per thousand - the number of grams of salt that is dissolved in 1 liter of water. If the salinity is less than 1 ppm, then this water is considered fresh. Salinity waters of the oceans in different places varies, but on average it is about 35 ppm.</p>
<p>The temperature of the oceans varies considerably, depending on the latitude and the depth. In the upper layers of the water near the equator is heated to + 28 ° C at the poles - only to -2 ° C. With the depth the water temperature decreases, but only the first 700 meters since no deeper sunlight. At greater depths all the water has the same temperature close to 0 ° C. But at the bottom of the water again becomes warmer because warm warm mantle that lies relatively shallow. Often through cracks in the crust of the ocean floor pulled out of hot water, heated to + 400 ° C.</p>
<p>Even the ocean is still poorly understood. This is especially true of its natural resources. Man is not fully learned to use the resources of the oceans. All living organisms that people use for their own use, called biological resources. Mineral resources - minerals that are deposited on the bottom and under the bottom of the ocean and valuable substances that can be extracted from seawater. The ocean is virtually inexhaustible energy resources, such as energy tides, wind waves and currents. In the future, people will be able to more fully learn the rich resources of the ocean.</p>
