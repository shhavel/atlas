<p>Creating a national Turkish state</p>
<p>The defeat in World War I led to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. England and France, rozchlenuvavshy Arab possessions of the Ottoman Empire, tried to do it with its own Turkish regions. Countries Allied control of the Straits, the French invaded Cilicia, British - Istanbul, Italy and Greece landed its troops in Asia Minor.</p>
<p>In response to Turkey was a movement for the preservation of integrity as a nation state. It was headed by General Mustafa Kemal. In the unoccupied part of Turkey in Ankara was called Grand National Assembly - the Majlis, who formed the government and army began forming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the puppet government of Sultan August 10, 1920 signed with the Entente Treaty of Sèvres, which recognized the division of the country. Turkey lost all possessions in the Middle East. Greece passed a part of European possessions and Izmir city in Asia Minor. On the eastern border of Turkey was formed Armenian state. On the territory of the Turkish regime introduced surrender, which effectively turned it into a semi-colony. Government Kemal rejected a contract. Then the support of the Greek forces in England began to attack inland.</p>
<p>In the fight against the Entente, Turkey has found an ally in the face of Soviet Russia. In March 1921 the two countries signed a treaty of friendship and brotherhood under the contract was determined the Soviet-Turkish border. Turkey gained territory in the Caucasus, which formerly belonged to Russia (Kara region), and Armenia, which in a way was divided and destroyed. Turkey has received financial and military aid from the RSFSR.</p>
<p>In October of the same year, a similar agreement was signed with the Soviet republics of the Caucasus, and in January 1922 signed a contract with the USSR, the delegation headed by M. Frunze. Last M.Kemalyu helped develop a plan for the defeat of the Greek armies.</p>
<p>In 1922 Turkish troops won the war. Entente was forced to sign a truce with the government of Kemal and thus recognize it. Position Sevres Treaty was revised. In the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne was signed, under which maintained the territorial integrity of the country as a nation state.</p>
<p>Foreign policy has led to the stabilization of domestic reform. Turkey became a republic (1923). Islam is separated from the state, abolished the Caliphate (1924) introduced the Latin alphabet. All the Turks were obliged to take a surname. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk took the family name - father of the Turks. The country has banned polygamy, civil marriage was required. The government started to support the national industry, with a focus on developing importzaminnyh industries. After the crisis of the 30's. The country introduced elements of economic planning and created the public sector.</p>
<p>Until the death of Atatürk in 1938, Turkey has been quite strong state. Ataturk was a model for nationalists Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Arab World</p>
<p>During the First World War, the British supported Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Important role in its organization played one of the most famous British spy, Thomas Edward Lawrence ("Lawrence of Arabia"). The Arabs were in favor of creating their own state. But to realize this desire was not to. After the war the Arab lands that were part of the Ottoman Empire was divided France and England. France invaded Lebanon and Syria, Britain established control over Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan. But in 1922 under pressure from the powerful national liberation movement in England was forced to grant independence to Egypt, but retaining its military presence in the country and control of the Suez Canal . Arab leaders, with a clear example of Egypt, trying to get rid of a new uprising by the Europeans. However antyanhliyske revolt in Palestine in 1922 and the anti-French uprising in Syria in 1925-1926. were brutally suppressed.</p>
<p>Only the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula, led by Ibn Saud managed to create a state which later became known as Saudi Arabia (1932). In 1932 Britain was forced to recognize the independence of Iraq.</p>
<p>The UK has launched the resettlement of Jews in Palestine to create their national focus, leading to a confrontation with the local Arabs displaced. Thus, held the classical imperial policy of "divide and rule".</p>
<p>The first unsuccessful attempt to create a unified Arab state gave Arab nationalism and anti-French antyanhliyskoyi orientation. As a result, in the 30's., Especially during the Second World War in this region increased influence of Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>The Palestinian problem</p>
<p>The idea of ​​creating a national center of Jewish proposed Austrian journalist Theodor Herzl in the middle of the nineteenth century. The Congress of the Zionist movement in Basel (Switzerland) in 1897, this idea received justification. It was decided to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. In the area of ​​25 thousand. Km2 expected to relocate 10 million Jews worldwide. At first Zionists offered to the Turkish Sultan, under whom Palestine was to sell this territory, but he refused. Nevertheless, the Jews began to emigrate illegally to Palestine, where she created closed communities which were subsistence farming.</p>
<p>During World War II, Sultan resorted to expulsion of the Jewish population, accusing him of attachment to the Entente. At the final stage of the war in 1917 Britain and France declared Balfour Declaration, which dealt with the return of the Jews to their historic homeland and the right to establish a national center in Palestine. This declaration has launched a new wave of migration.</p>
<p>In Palestine started to Jewish political and military organization. In 1922 Britain received the League of Nations mandate to govern Palestine. This immediately provoked an uprising against the British Arabs and Jews. At that time, Jews constituted 18% of the Palestinian population. Rebellion crushed, but the tension in the relations between the Arab and Jewish communities and the colonial administration remained.</p>
<p>By the late 30's. England helped displaced Jews. When the ratio of Jewish and Arab population was threatening the stability of the British colonial empire, Britain banned the relocation. In the 1936-1939 biennium. Between Arabs and Jews there was a real war, while Arab and Jewish militias and fought against the British. However, in Jewish political circles have firmly established the idea of ​​the founding of the state. In Palestine, the Jewish created "shadow" political structures - the government, local authorities, armed groups. Under favorable conditions they had to declare state of Israel.</p>
<p>Arabs strongly opposed the creation of a Jewish state, which strengthened inter-ethnic fighting in Palestine, which continues to date.</p>
