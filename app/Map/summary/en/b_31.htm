<p>Agriculture - other (after industry) in terms of production sector in the world economy. It plays a crucial role in providing food and some raw materials industries.</p>
<p>Agriculture is comprehensive in nature, using land resources (farmland), and surface and ground water for irrigation and water supply for the needs of livestock. Significant influence on the development of agriculture and its specialization with climatic conditions (agro-climatic resources), topography and soil fertility.</p>
<p>The result is a concentration of agricultural specialization of agricultural enterprises the same industry in a particular area. The objective prerequisites for the formation of specialization is favorable natural conditions for the development of certain areas of agriculture, traditional labor skills of the population of the area and the availability of food markets and raw materials. Specialization creates conditions for the intensification of agricultural production - increasing productivity through the introduction of scientific and technological progress.</p>
<p>In agriculture, there are two major areas: crop production (agriculture) and livestock. Other industries (fishing, apiculture, sericulture) play a much smaller role.</p>
<p>Leading sector in most developing countries, there is a crop. Only some of them dominated by livestock. For example, in North Africa and Southwest Asia due to poverty of soil and aridity of the climate crop barely growing, and with developed livestock industries are sheep and verblyudyarstvo.</p>
<p>In highly developed countries are the main livestock, which gives most of the agricultural products and provides a major part of the population of protein (meat, milk, eggs).</p>
