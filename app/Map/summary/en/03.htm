<p>Sovereign countries have a variety of forms of organization of the state - the state system, consisting of a form of government and forms of administrative-territorial structure.</p>
<p>There are two forms of government: republic and the monarchy. In the republics of the supreme legislative power belongs to the Parliament (Representation-national elected body). Depending on how the powers are distributed between the parliament and the president of the republic may have presidential, parliamentary or presidential-parliamentary form of government.</p>
<p>Monarchy (in Greek monarchia - "autocracy") - is a form of government in which the supreme power is wholly or partly owned by the sovereign (king, prince, sultan, emir, emperor, etc.) and is inherited. Monarchy may be absolute, when the monarch's power is virtually unlimited (Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Brunei) and constitutional (UK, Spain, Japan, Morocco), when the monarch's power is limited by the constitution, legislative functions were transferred to the Parliament, the executive - the government and the monarch is formally is the supreme power of the carrier actually performs representative functions.</p>
<p>A variation of the absolute monarchy - theocratic monarchy, where the monarch is also the head of a religious organization (Vatican, Saudi Arabia).</p>
<p>Special and unique in the world is a form of government Jamahiriya (Libya), which in Arabic - "the country of the masses." The official name of the country - the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.</p>
<p>Another, very common, form of government are member states of the British Commonwealth of Nations, led by Britain. Legally, the Commonwealth was formalized in 1949. Then he entered the United Kingdom and its dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, Union of South Africa, Ireland). After the Second World War and the collapse of the British Empire in the Commonwealth remained the majority of former British possessions. Now as part of the Commonwealth of 50 countries as republics and monarchies, which may pursue an independent policy or be dependent, but unites them is that they all recognize the supreme authority of the British Queen.</p>
<p>Administrative-territorial division of the state apparatus involves certain areas in accordance with national, historical, economic, environmental and other factors. There are two forms of administrative-territorial structure, unitary and federal. Unitary states do not incorporate self-governing entities. In such states are unified constitution and system of government authorities. Federated States consist of federal units (states, republics, land, etc.), which is part of self-delegated functions within national laws and authorities. In the world there are about 30 federal states (Germany, Russia, USA).</p>
<p>Dependent countries and territories are under the authority of foreign states metropolitan and deprived of political sovereignty and economic independence (Bermuda - a dependent territory of the UK, French Guiana, and others).</p>
