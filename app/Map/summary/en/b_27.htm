<p>Non-ferrous metals - a branch of industry, including the extraction of non-ferrous metals and the production of these metals and alloys. Placement of deposits of non-ferrous metals is shown on the map mineral resources.</p>
<p>The most common in commercial use ferrous metal combined into groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>light metals (aluminum, titanium, magnesium);</li>
<li>heavy metals (copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel);</li>
<li>precious metals (gold, silver, platinum);</li>
<li>alloying metals (tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum).</li>
</ul>
<p>Light metals are widely used for the production of aviation and space technology, marine vessels and equipment for chemical plants. The demand for them is growing. Among the most common light metals in the earth's crust are rocks that contain aluminum. Because aluminum production is a major industry-ferrous metallurgy. The raw material for aluminum is bauxite. Production of aluminum consists of two stages. First - getting alumina (aluminum oxide), tends to bauxite areas. Second - the smelting of primary aluminum from alumina by electrolysis. Production of aluminum metal is quite energy-intensive, so it tends to electricity.</p>
<p>Production of alumina has spread to Australia, Jamaica, China, Brazil, Russia - countries with available raw material base. And aluminum production - in Russia, Australia, China and the countries that smelt aluminum from imported raw materials (Japan, Italy, Canada, Norway, Germany, Bahrain, UAE). Among exporting countries, Canada ranked first and produces the cheapest aluminum.</p>
<p>Casting heavy metal tends mainly to raw material sources. Copper, tin, nickel mined mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In these countries, established the initial stages of metals, mining, milling, smelting crude metal, so-called dirty production. Higher stages of production (refining, alloys and receive rental) is concentrated in developed countries (the US, Japan, Western Europe).</p>
<p>Lead-zinc industry as a raw material used polymetallic ores. The largest producer of zinc and lead are the US, Canada, Japan, France, Mexico, Peru, Australia.</p>
