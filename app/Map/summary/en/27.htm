<p>Chemical industry, as one of the branches of the avant-garde trio, developing dynamically. Twentieth century is called the century of use of chemicals - so wide was the use of chemical materials and technologies in all spheres of the economy and everyday life. This production of cheap and various synthetic materials (plastics, photopolymers, chemical fiber, rubber, organic glass, film), and the products of basic chemistry (fertilizers, acids, soda, detergents). The development of the chemical industry offers opportunities to create new technology recycling of many sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>The raw material base is broad and diverse industry. Besides mineral chemical raw area uses all kinds of fuel resources (especially oil and gas), wood, water, air, and industrial wastes. Chemical industry is best represented in the developed world, where they formed the main industry areas with a wide range of products. The European region produces 40% of the production industry. Leading countries are Germany (concern BASF - the largest chemical manufacturer in the world), France, UK, Italy, specializing in new high-end products. The second region is North America, almost as meaningfully Europe. United States is the world leader in the production of polymeric materials and caustic soda. The third region is the East and South-East Asia, which is considered a powerful center of Japan. Powerful Japanese petrochemical works on imported oil. Rapidly developing chemical industry in China (specializes in the manufacture of fertilizers and petrochemicals). The fourth region formed in Eastern Europe on the basis of rich raw materials and energy resources. High level of development of the chemical industry is also characterized Australia.</p>
<p>Among developing countries, the chemical industry is increasing, especially where there are significant reserves of oil and natural gas (Venezuela, Indonesia, the Gulf region). In other countries, extract certain types of mining and chemical raw materials.</p>
