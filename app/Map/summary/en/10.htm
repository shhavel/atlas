<p>Map of Quaternary deposits takes ideas about the origin of certain quaternary structure under the influence of recent and contemporary natural processes. These activities and rivers (alluvial deposits), weathering processes (eluvium - loose sediments that lie where formed, talus - the products of weathering, pulled down from the slopes of the waters and sediments; proluvium - sediments formed by the activity of ephemeral streams), the activities of the wind (aeolian deposits), and their melting glaciers. Quaternary sediments cover older rocks that are exposed in the river valleys, ravines, gullies, quarries. Sediments play an important role in the formation of soil formation landscapes, as well as a resource for the construction industry.</p>
