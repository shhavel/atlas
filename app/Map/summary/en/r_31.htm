<p>Climate</p>
<p>The main factors that determine the specific features of the climate of the continent, there is a significant length of North America from north to south, the plainness of its central regions, as well as close to the meridional trending mountain ranges.</p>
<p>To continent characterized by significant temperature differences of its various parts, and as a result - a big difference in atmospheric pressure causes movement of air masses from the Arctic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico inland.</p>
<p>On the continent was recorded the highest temperature of the Western Hemisphere 56,7 ° C (Death Valley). Lowest temperature reaches 70 ° C (Greenland). In winter the central region often a clash of arctic and tropical air masses, accompanied by considerable variability of weather and sharp fluctuations in temperature.</p>
<p>Dominant on the continent is west air mass transfer. However, its greatest impact is felt on the windward slopes of the Cordillera. Here falls to 3000 mm (in some areas ranges - up to 6000 mm) of precipitation.</p>
<p>The influence of the Atlantic Ocean on the climate of North America mainly limited to the coastal strip. The reason for this - the mountain system of the Appalachians in the east of the continent.</p>
<p>Sea currents have a significant impact on the climate of the coastal areas of North America. Thanks to the warm Alaska Current noticeably softened the Pacific coast climate temperate. However for those located in the same latitudes east coast of the continent are characterized by a much harsher climate due to the influence of cold Labrador Current.</p>
<p>In summary we can say that the continent is characterized by extreme temperature conditions contrast, the prevalence of western air mass transfer in temperate latitudes and limited coastal area of ​​influence of the oceans.</p>
<p>Natural areas</p>
<p>Distribution of natural areas in North America has the features associated with the peculiarities of relief: in the central part of the continent natural areas with meridional circulation.</p>
<p>To Greenland and the islands of the Canadian archipelago, which lies in the area of ​​the Arctic desert, characterized by harsh climatic conditions, very rich flora and fauna. The vegetation consists mainly of mosses and lichens that occur on the ice-free areas of land. The overwhelming majority of animals (walrus, seal) is associated with the ocean.</p>
<p>In the far north of the mainland tundra zone except mosses and lichens growing herbs and shrubs, and dwarf birch and alder. Such a poor vegetation cover tundra-marsh soils, yet unpretentious enough for caribou and deer musk ox. There are also polar bears, arctic foxes. Further south, the tundra flora of shrubs supplemented with willow and alder, spruce and larch, growing along river valleys.</p>
<p>Taiga zone is characterized by long and severe winters and short warm summers and fairly. Here podzolic and wetland permafrost taiga soils comfortable enough feel some species of pine and larch, spruce, fir. Varied and the local fauna (wolf, bear, fox, deer, elk, lynx, etc.).</p>
<p>Areas of mixed and deciduous forests are common in the eastern part of the continent. Along with the pine trees are fairly well represented hardwoods: oak, beech, linden, aspen, birch, and maple, that due to the unusual color of the leaves provides exceptional beauty a local forests.</p>
<p>The forests are home to deer, porcupines, brown bears and many other fauna.</p>
<p>Significant the central part of the continent is occupied by steppe and steppe zones. A considerable amount of heat, adequate moisture and fertile soils promoted intensive economic development prairies (so named ever here steppe). The brightest representatives of the animal world is bison that used by thousands of grazing on these fertile lands.</p>
<p>Now these beautiful animals can be found only in the reserves. The fauna is also represented by rodents (gopher, groundhog), reptiles (snake, rattlesnake) and birds (bald eagle).</p>
<p>And semi-desert zones formed in the interior highlands of the Cordillera. On poor soils sirozemnyh here grow mainly cacti and some other undemanding to water the plants. The fauna is represented by reptiles (rattlesnake) and various rodents.</p>
<p>Then a narrow strip on the Pacific coast area extends tverdolystyh forest and scrub (Mediterranean) on brown soils which can meet various kinds of pines, redwoods and relict species of evergreen oaks.</p>
<p>Large tracts of south-eastern mainland area covers variable-wet (including monsoon) forests. The characteristic features of this area are the yellow-and chervonozemni soils with different vegetation (pine, evergreen oak, magnolia, palm). The fauna is represented by alligators, turtles, snakes, rattlesnakes, a large number of birds.</p>
<p>Altitudinal zonation is most clearly seen in the Cordilleras. A set of zones varies as the Cordillera from north to south and from west to east, due to the length of the mountain system through the entire continent and significant differences wetting regime of the western and eastern slopes of the mountains.</p>
