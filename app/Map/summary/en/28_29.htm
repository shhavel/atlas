<p>The set of people who live around the globe, called humanity, population or population. Population is the object of study of many sciences, one of which is demography (in Greek - "description of the people"), which studies the processes of formation of size, composition of the population, and especially its location.</p>
<p>There is no consensus regarding the time of appearance of mankind on Earth at present exists. However, most scientists believe that human ancestors appeared about 2 million years ago, and the modern type of man - only 40 thousand. Years ago. Modern science says that the first humans appeared in Africa. From here, people settled on all continents except Antarctica. Oselyayuchys a particular area, certain groups of people over time under the influence of changing environmental conditions by forming their own appearance, temperament, character and other features. Thus formed the main group of people - the human race. There are four main races: Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Negroid and avstraloyidnu. Some scientists unite Negroids avstraloyidiv and one equatorial race.</p>
<p>Caucasoid race formed the indigenous peoples of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Even in ancient times Caucasoids inhabited central and southern Asia, and later - America and Australia. For Caucasians characteristic mainly bright color, soft straight or slightly wavy hair, narrow nose, thin lips. By Caucasian owned almost half of humanity. All Slavs, including Ukrainian, are Caucasians.</p>
<p>The people of the Mongoloid race formed over vast areas of Asia and settled in North and South America, the Pacific Islands. It includes nearly 40% of world population. Distinctive anthropometric characteristics of Mongoloids is a yellowish color, black straight hair, narrow eyes, wide nose, ploskuvate face.</p>
<p>Negroid race of nations formed equatorial Africa. In Negroids dark skin, black curly hair, dark brown eyes, broad nose, thick lips. The coat on the body is poorly developed.</p>
<p>Avstraloyidiv of Negroids differ lighter color eyes and wavy hair. This race up the indigenous peoples of Australia and surrounding islands (Aboriginal). Unlike other races, Australoid race has not acquired considerable popularity and are less numerous, and even endangered.</p>
<p>As a result of the settlement beyond indigenous habitats of different races formed transitional and mixed race. Scientists have proved the equality of all races. Significant contribution to the development of the theory of equality of races has made Nicholas Maclay, who dedicated his life to the study of the peoples inhabiting the tropical Pacific islands. In 1870-1883 years he lived among the Papuans of New Guinea and cultural development is significantly different from European standards. The natives lived under the Stone Age. Examining their lives M.Mykluho-Maclay concluded that these people just as capable of intellectual development, education and the arts, like any other nation on Earth. A retardation of these people is due primarily to a significant distance from the centers of their residence centers of civilization.</p>
<p>Under some assumptions have 15 thousand. Years ago the Earth population of 3 million people. At the beginning of our era the world's population increased to 250 million people. From ancient history we know that in ancient times from having first tribal peoples. They lived in the slave states of Africa and Eurasia. Today, more than 2 thousand. Different nations. Most folks are Chinese - they are more than 1 billion. At the same time, there are people whose number does not exceed a few hundred representatives. In Ukraine, for example, these are the enemies used - a small nation in the Crimea.</p>
<p>The growth rate of the world's population every year accelerated. If the first millennium AD, the population increased by 25 million. People, then for the second millennium, mankind grew to 6 billion people. This is due to the fact that man has learned to produce the required amount of food, and the development of science, especially medicine, helped overcome many diseases has significantly improved the living conditions of people. This effect on life expectancy, reducing infant mortality and a corresponding increase in population. The most rapidly growing population from 50-ies of XX century. During this period, there was a so-called population explosion. Over the past 40 years, world population has doubled. This rapid population growth was mainly due to the increase number of people in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This is due to the improvement of living conditions in these countries and national traditions of a large family.</p>
<p>Most of the world's population accounts for 20 major nations, whose number exceeds 50 million. These primarily include Chinese, hindustantsi, Americans, ben“ëaltsi, Brazilians, Russians, Japanese, Mexicans, Germans, Vietnamese, Turks, Iranians, British, French, Italian.</p>
<p>Today the world's population exceeds 6.5 billion, but placed it evenly through different climatic and historical factors. Most people live in the south and south-east Asia and in Western and Central Europe. These areas account for 70% of the world population. And the two countries, China and India account for over a third of earthlings. Resident population is not only in the Antarctic, because of the extremely harsh natural conditions here are only temporary staff research stations.</p>
