<p><b>Physical map of the hemispheres</b></p>
<p>If the imaginary meridian divide the globe into two hemispheres and received hemisphere played on a sheet, we will have a map of the Western and Eastern hemispheres. The entire surface of the Earth is represented on the map by using different colors. Yellow, green and brown of various shades affects land and blue and blue - water.</p>
<p>On the physical map of the hemispheres held the line from top to bottom and from left to right - a degree grid.</p>
<p>It is formed by meridians and parallels.</p>
<p>Meridian - an imaginary line connecting the North and South poles and carried downward.</p>
<p>Parallels - an imaginary line, made from left to right.</p>
<p>Since both meridians and parallels are imaginary lines on the ground because they can not see.</p>
<p>On the map surface is much reduced, so using symbols indicate only the most important objects: the oceans, continents, seas, highest mountains, the largest plains, rivers, cities.</p>
