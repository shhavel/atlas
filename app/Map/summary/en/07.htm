<p>The world's population lives in settlements of two types: urban and rural. Urban settlements are where most of the people working in the industry and services. In rural areas the majority of residents are employed in the agricultural sector of the economy. It should be noted that the same for all the criteria for inclusion of settlements to urban or rural non-existent. Some of the state for taking such a legally enforceable number of inhabitants in the settlements.</p>
<p>Urbanization (Latin - "urban") - is the process of urban growth, the increase in urban population, increasing the role of cities in the life of society and the spread of urban lifestyles.</p>
<p>For 2000, lived in cities, more than half the world's population. It can be argued that urbanization today has become global. Its modern phase inherent in the three characteristic features:</p>
<p>1. Rapid increase in the share of the urban population</p>
<p>(At the beginning of the nineteenth century. Lived in cities 3% of the world population</p>
<p>at the beginning of the twentieth century. lived in cities 14% of the world population</p>
<p>at the beginning of the XXI century. The city is home of 51% of the world population).</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. further concentration of population and economy in large (over 100 thousand. Residents) towns and cities-millionaires.</p>
<p>In 2000, there were about 400 city-millionaires. The largest city in the world consider Tokyo, with a population of 26.4 million inhabitants.</p>
<p>3. The expansion of the city and the merging of closely spaced cities, united by the political, labor, cultural, domestic, industrial, administrative and managerial constraints in a single unit - the urban agglomeration (Latin - "Join").</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third millennium in the world, there were 20 urban agglomerations and their number is constantly increasing. Highest stage is the formation of modern urbanization mega (from Greek - "big city"). It results from the merger of the neighboring agglomerations, forming a single infrastructure. By the end of the twentieth century. The world was six mega, of which:</p>
<p></p>
<p>three in the United States:</p>
<p>Northeast megalopolis - along the Atlantic from Boston to Washington with a population of about 50 million inhabitants;</p>
<p>Lakeside - the south coast of the Great Lakes, with a population of 35 million inhabitants;</p>
<p>California (18 million inhabitants).</p>
<p></p>
<p>two in Europe:</p>
<p>English (combines agglomeration London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool);</p>
<p>Rhine (agglomeration Randstad in the Netherlands and the Rhine-Ruhr, Rhine-Main in Germany).</p>
<p></p>
<p>one in Japan</p>
<p>Tokaido (agglomeration of Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto).</p>
<p>Significant differences exist between countries in the level and pace of urbanization. The highest level in the developed countries. In most developing countries, the level of urbanization is relatively low, but the urban population is increasing rapidly, as is due to urban migration of the rural population. This phenomenon is called psevdourbanizatsiey, as a sharp increase in the urban population is not accompanied by the spread of the urban lifestyle.</p>
<p>Natural population growth - a measure which, together with the birth and death rates characterizes the dynamics of continuous recovery of generations of people, ie, the process of human reproduction. It is characterized by the rate of natural increase, calculated as the difference between the birth and death rates (per 1 000 thousand. Population).</p>
<p>Natural growth depends on many factors. By the XVIII century. World population growth depended mainly on biological processes. At the same levels of fertility and mortality rates were very high and, as a result - low natural increase (see. The graph on the map "the distribution of population"). In our time, a more significant impact on the process of reproduction of the population acquire socio-economic factors: the level of welfare and living conditions of people, the level of development of medicine, state of health and nutrition, the degree of involvement of women to participate in public life, the relationship between urban and rural populations, national and religious traditions, etc. Among the global historical reasons that hinder the natural growth of the population - political upheaval, social crises, deteriorating environmental conditions of stay.</p>
<p>Rate of natural increase can be positive, negative or zero. In most countries there is a positive natural increase. High rates of population growth are called population explosion and have become one of the global problems of mankind. The solution to this problem lies in holding governments of the appropriate demographic policies.</p>
<p>The predominance of mortality over the birth rate - negative natural increase is called depopulation. This phenomenon is typical for countries with economies in transition (Ukraine, Latvia, Hungary, Bulgaria) and some developed European countries (Germany, Sweden).</p>
