<p><b>Civilization and culture of the peoples of the world at the end of the XV century.</b></p>
<p>Late medieval picture of the world in the view of Europeans was extremely imperfect. The limit of the lands known to Europeans, the Chinese and the Arabs on the eve of the Age of Discovery is not covered the whole world. Those early explorers sometimes called "prisoners of sushi."</p>
<p>European explorers have long mastered the surrounding seas. However, in the Atlantic Ocean, they dared to spend only a short journey guided by coastal landmarks. Further, they believed, is a "sea of ​​darkness" - Oceans, arising from the Flood. Sail south dangerous because there kingdom of the devil and of the equator, where it is impossible to breathe, they will inevitably perish. Overcoming every mile toward the south was a victory for the Europeans on their own fear.</p>
<p>Gaining experience, European explorers, traders and various adventurers smilivishaly. The end of the XV century. they were ready to go into research voyage in search of new lands. At the same time, in many places of the world have evolved civilization, unknown to Europeans.</p>
<p>In Central and South America reached the zenith of the empire of the Aztecs and Incas. In Africa, the impact of Europeans felt only the coastal peoples of the continent.</p>
<p>Life of people in the interior of Africa remained unchanged for centuries, so the indigenous Africans Europeans considered savages.</p>
<p>South and East Asia at the end of the XV century. were regions where civilization dominated high-level development with the development of economy and culture.</p>
<p>In China, the Ming dynasty rules. Despite the flourishing of the arts at the moment of its ruling, the development of Chinese society has slowed significantly.</p>
<p>India was divided into many states, the largest of which was the Delhi Sultanate. The country attracted Europeans with their fabulous wealth, especially spices, which were highly valued in Europe at that time.</p>
<p>The end of the XV century. the world was on the verge of great change. That Europeans are destined to begin a new era in the history of mankind, to establish a direct connection between the continents.</p>
<p><b>The great geographical discoveries and travels late XV - the first half of the XVII century. Education colonial empires</b></p>
<p>The great geographical discoveries called discoveries made by European travelers late XV - the first half of the XVII century. The impetus for it was the search for Europeans a new sea route to India, bypassing the possessions of the Ottoman Empire. First started to look for new ways to Eastern countries Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p>In winter 1488 a Portuguese fleet led by Captain Bartolomeu Dias, skirting the west coast of Africa, has reached its southern edge and went to the Indian Ocean, previously thought closed sea. Thus, it was found possible to achieve this principle by India.</p>
<p>Sea route to India along the western coast of Africa was discovered as a result of the expedition 1497 - 1499 pp. Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama. Consequently, the Arab merchants lost their monopoly position of intermediaries in trade with the countries of South Asia, and the region was in the sphere of colonial expansion of Portugal.</p>
<p>The first to reach India and Eastern Asia Western tried by Christopher Columbus. He headed the Spanish government expedition consisted of three caravels, "Santa Maria", "Pinta" and "Nina". October 12, 1492, when, after a 69-day voyage reached the Bahamas, is considered the date of the discovery of America. However, the discovery of Columbus was not properly assessed once - Spanish treasury is not a significant profit.</p>
<p>The value of the discovery of America to Spain was informed only in the middle of the XVI century. When, after the conquest of the Indian states of South and Central America to Europe in large numbers began to receive gold and silver.</p>
<p>The discovery led to the aggravation of Columbus rivalry between Spain and Portugal over the ownership of the new lands. For the settlement of disputes through the mediation of the Pope was signed two agreements on the division of spheres of influence between these states. The agreement concluded in 1494 in Tordesillas defined possession of Spain and Portugal</p>
<p>in the Western Hemisphere, and in 1529 in Zaragoza - in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The first voyage around the world has made the Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan in 1519 - 1521 pp. result, it has been conclusively established the existence of a vast ocean between America and Asia. It was also the first time authentically proved that the Earth is a sphere and obtain general information about the size.</p>
<p><b>English-Spanish struggle XVI - XVII centuries. Colonial trade in the Atlantic</b></p>
<p>The division of the world between Spain and Portugal did not suit the other European states. "Let us show the item in the will of Adam" - demanded the French king Francis I - "by which the New World is to be divided between the mine, the kings of Spain and Portugal, and I should not have as its part of his legacy."</p>
<p>The Spaniards banned the trade with the colonies in the Western Hemisphere to the merchants of other countries. However, contrary to merchants not to send to the New World. The Spaniards were arrested and their boats confiscated goods. European monarchs, who seek to protect victims, allowed them to capture as compensation Spanish loads. Maritime piracy XVI - XVII centuries. Atlantic was profitable and important activity that engaged the nobles and merchants.</p>
<p>From the Mediterranean to the Atlantic moved the main trade routes. It formed a trade "triangle" between Europe, Africa and America, which united them in a new system of world trade.</p>
<p>The great geographical discoveries were remarkable time in the history of the European peoples. They abandoned the Mediterranean-continental vision of the world and spread it across the ocean, have found new meaning in relationships with other people.</p>
