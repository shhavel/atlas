In the north-east - Donetsk Upland, which is west of the region enters the Dnieper Lowland, and in the south-west - the Azov Upland. On limestone and salt deposits are widespread karst landforms abyss career. The main wealth of mineral resources are coal of the Donets Basin, and deposits of rock salt, brown coal, minerals ferrous metallurgy and production of construction materials (dolomite, limestone flux, marl, gypsum, chalk, tripoli, sand, quartzite, granite) . There are reserves for the chemical industry and metallurgy (nefelionovi syenites, fluorite, vermiculite, iron ore - in the Azov Sea, Dawsonite, potassium salt). The world famous Mykytivskomufield mercury. The climate is temperate continental with relatively cold and snowy winters (-7,8 ° in January), hot and dry summers (+ 20,8 °, + 22,8 ° in July). Precipitation - 375-556 mm per year. About 110 rivers belong to the basins of the Black and Azov Seas, 47 of them full length of 25 km.

The fauna consists of 400 species, including 300 species of birds. Natural processes - erosion, denudation, a surface wash, accelerated technological capacity. Developed salt karst. Technological-ecological situation is characterized by: samozahoryannyam coal on heaps, pollution of air, soil and water. Reclamation measures, land reclamation, afforestation of slopes of ravines and gullies, planting heaps, creating shelterbelts, afforestation along rivers and other bodies of water.
