<p>Throughout the lifetime of human civilization there was interaction between nature and humanity. With rovytkom technological progress and population growth was increasing human pressure on the environment. At one time, the moment when the change components of nature has reached such proportions that restore the natural balance was impossible without coordination and cooperation of efforts of all countries of the world.</p>
<p>Reducing the area of ​​forests, desertification, pollution, greenhouse effect, ozone depletion in the world - are among the environmental problems that can be classified as global. Solving these problems is possible only if the efforts of all mankind. To also include global issues of war and peace, poverty, combating terrorism, demographic problems and so on.</p>
<p>A direct consequence of reducing the woodlands area is the reduction of oxygen in the atmosphere, soil erosion, desertification, reduction of populations of living organisms.</p>
<p>As a result of the greenhouse effect can occur general warming, increasing water level of the oceans and flooding large parts of coastal areas.</p>
<p>The deterioration of the ozone situation is fraught with serious negative consequences for the natural world planet. May yield some noticeable fall crops, and increasing doses of ultraviolet radiation will lead to significant weakening of the human immune system and will cause many diseases.</p>
<p>The major pollutants of the atmosphere is industrially developed countries. Here zosoredzheni powerful industry, a great number of vehicles, which together cause significant emissions of harmful substances. The first effective measure to overcome this problem is the signing and entry into force in February 2005, the so-called Kyoto Protocol. Under this agreement, each participating country undertakes to comply with the limits on harmful emissions into the atmosphere by quotas.</p>
<p>Significant contamination suffered water of the oceans due to disposal of various wastes, accident vehicles, disasters and more.</p>
<p>Notable among the contaminated territories occupied areas of nuclear testing and radiation accidents. Some of these regions excluded from economic use for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. This is proof that even local incidents at nuclear installations and testing, not to mention the use of nuclear weapons pose a terrible threat to mankind. An alternative to this may be proliferation of nuclear arsenals followed by a total ban of nuclear weapons on Earth, as well as streamlining the activities of civilian nuclear facilities.</p>
