<p>Geographic zones and natural areas are zonal natural systems.</p>
<p>Because the climate is the most important defining characteristic of geographical zones, they tend to coincide with climatic zones. In addition to geographic climate zones are characterized by certain soil and vegetation, inland waters, the processes of relief and so on.</p>
<p>Smaller zonal complexes are natural areas, the defining characteristic of which is the ratio of heat and moisture, forming a type of climate, soil and vegetation, fauna. Because the vegetation is the most expressive feature of a natural area, which are named for the dominant type of vegetation (zone of taiga, desert and semi-desert area, etc.).</p>
<p>Since the main characteristics of natural areas is strongly dependent on incoming solar energy and the climatic conditions in general, natural areas vary from the equator to the poles. However, as climatic conditions, natural areas are not distributed perfectly to latitude - on placement significantly affects a number of other factors, including the importance of play relief. In the highlands changing environmental conditions has certain characteristics: lower temperatures and changing rainfall cause the high-altitude zone. The higher the mountain system, the closer it is to the equator, the greater the number and range of altitudinal zones.</p>
