<p><b>General Information</b></p>
<p>It lies on the south-west of Ukraine within the south-western part of the Ukrainian Carpathians. About 80% of the area occupied by mountain ranges, valleys and basins mizhhirnyh. The south-west - Transcarpathian lowland (lowland part Serednodunayskoyi). Within lowland terrain plains (102-120 m) in the Carpathians lowland and midland. Mountain ranges stretch from northwest to southeast in the north - Dividing Range, extending south Polonynskyi spine (g-rune Mountain Valley, 1479 m), divided into separate arrays (Borzhava Red) and Svidovetsky spine (g Blyznytsia, 1 883 m), east of which - the backbone of Montenegro with the highest in Ukraine Mt. (2061 m) and Rakhovsky mountains. The region found 30 kinds of minerals, including uncharacteristic for Ukraine: polymetallic ore, alunite, perlite, zeolite, liparites. In Solotvynsky field - about 3.5 billion tons of salt. Open 13 deposits of carbonaceous material (marbled limestone, dolomite, marble), more than 360 mineral water springs (on the basis of these sources, there are several resorts). Barite deposits of ore. There are reserves of brown coal. The climate is continental. In the lowland winter is short, mild (-2 °, -3 ° in January), summers are warm (+ 19 °, + 21 ° in July), in the middle winter is cold, prolonged (-5 °, -9 ° in January), summers are short and cool (+ 9 °, + 13 °). In the mountains, there is a decrease in temperature with height. Annual precipitation varies from 642 mm (Riverside) to 1411 mm (Ust-Black). The Carpathian 152 river length of 10 km. They belong to the basin of the Tisza and almost all originate in the mountains. The largest rivers are Tisa Teresva, Tereblia, Rick, Borzhava, Latoritsa Oh. For typical river floods after heavy rains (8-10 floods per year). In the region of 137 lakes of glacial origin and zahatnoho (most - Synevyr, 989 m above sea level), 50 lakes and reservoirs.</p>
<p>Soils mainly - brown acid and sod-brownsoil, brownsoil-podzolic (on hills, in the foothills and on the high terraces of mountain rivers), meadow brownsoil - on the lower terraces, and the plain - turf ashed and surface-gley. About 50% of the territory is covered by forest. Clearly marked altitudinal zonation of vegetation. In the Transcarpathian Lowland hornbeam-oak and oak forests in the foothills and mountains to an altitude of 700 m - oak, up to 1 300 m - beech, 1 500-1 550 m -yalynovi with admixtures of beech, fir, cedar pine, above - subalpine and alpine meadows like. Meadow vegetation is common in river valleys and on mountain slopes and ridges. The fauna is rich, represented by 450 species: mammals - 70 species of birds - 280 fish - 60. Adverse natural processes: in the mountains - earthquakes (up 8.9 points), frequent avalanches, intense weathering, particularly frosty; landslides, talus, landslides. During the catastrophic floods - intensive erosive and accumulative activity of rivers. On the Tisza and its tributaries are often formed mudslides between Borzhava and Teresva common karst. Strong winds cause fallen trees. Reclamation measures: ravine-beam planting and afforestation along rivers and ponds, terracing of slopes, creating vodorehulyuyuchi dams, fixing riverbanks. In Transcarpathia - 457 territories and objects protected areas, where national importance: Biosphere Reserve, 2 national parks, 18 wildlife refuges, 9 natural monuments, botanical garden, park, monument of landscape architecture, 12 natural reserves.</p>
<p><b>Historical Background</b></p>
<p>The first people on the territory of Ukraine appeared in Transcarpathia (archaeological traces of ancient man about town queen). At times there chronicle Slavic tribe settled the White Croats.
