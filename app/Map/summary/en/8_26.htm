<p>An important factor in the development of the spiritual life of Ukraine was the cultural politics Ukrainian hetman, aims to support the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, National Education, typography and art.</p>
<p>However, the development of Ukrainian culture spryamuvavsya dismemberment Ukrainian lands and unequal conditions of their development.</p>
<p>The desire to establish control over the Ukrainian cultural life - a characteristic feature of the colonial policy of any of the States owned land in Ukraine.
