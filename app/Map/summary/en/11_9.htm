<p>Opposition Movement 1950- 1980's</p>
<p>During the long dictatorship of Joseph Stalin any manifestation of opposition suppressed with extreme cruelty. In the Dnieper Ukraine eradicated all forms of dissent in the 1930s, in Western Ukraine - to mid-1950s. In the circumstances, after the war, could no longer speak about methods of struggle for Ukraine proposed UNO. Its active members either died or were in exile and almost no effect on events in the USSR. However, the reasons that gave birth to discontent communist reality, not disappeared. The death of Stalin's personality cult and debunking the XX Party Congress instilled hope for the democratization of life and the possibility of pluralism. So distraught after defeats and seemingly destroyed forever Ukrainian movement began to gently climb. Representatives from conscious Ukrainian intellectuals started sounding yet timid voice for the protection of the rights of the Ukrainian nation and human rights.</p>
<p>The main focus of the independent public opinion became major cities - especially Kyiv. Lviv, Kharkiv, Odessa. Along with an open cultural and literary activities aimed at exposing the crimes of the Stalinist regime, and the problems of Ukrainian culture and language, there were also illegal organization. Their work touches the revival of Ukrainian statehood, freedom of conscience, conversion to democratic ideals. Typically, these organizations soon exposed with by the KGB and their participants fell into prison on charges of "Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism", "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda", "sabotage."</p>
<p>The most striking phenomenon against the backdrop of social and political life of Ukraine late 1950's and early 1960's was the work of "the Sixties." These were young people nationally conscious Ukrainian writers and poets: Lina Kostenko. Basil Simonenko, Ivan Drach, John Svitlychny Sverstyuk Eugene, Nicholas Vingranovsky Alla Horska, Ivan Dziuba. Vasyl Stus, Michael Osadchiy, Igor and Irina Kalynets John Gel, Horyn brothers. His works are aroused public opinion, pointing out the differences between communist theory and real life. Their activities did not extend beyond Soviet legislation, but the potential risk of the existing system.</p>
<p>Repression on the opposition collapsed in the early 60's. In 1961 the Criminal Code of the Ukrainian SSR were the items that are much broader interpretations of the concept of "anti-Soviet activity." And in 1965 the country were mass arrests freethinkers.</p>
<p>Along with the intellectual opposition was growing discontent of the workers. The reason was the deteriorating economic situation in the USSR and sharp aggravation of the food problem. Protests workers expressed in disaster strikes. During Stalin's speeches are threatened with exile or death to participants. So in 1962 the communist authorities resorted to the usual method of solving problems, Having shot demonstration of workers in Novocherkassk (Rostov Region).</p>
<p>The arrival of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev was marked by attempts to minimize the pseudo liberal course of his predecessor and eliminate fruit "Khrushchev thaw". In Ukraine, the pogroms and zalyakuvannyaopozytsiynoyi intelligentsia resumed in 1972 when Petro Shelest at the post of first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party succeeded Vladimir Shcherbytsky. New impetus dissident movement gave the signing of the Helsinki Agreement (1975), in which the Soviet leadership to the whole world community undertook to respect the civil rights of their citizens. Immediately all Soviet republics, including Ukraine (November 1976), formed community groups for Supervision agreement signed in Helsinki. Ukrainian Helsinki Group headed by writer Mykola Rudenko, its active leader Petro Grigorenko. Nina Motley. Vasyl Stus, Lev Lukyanenko, John Kandyba Hope Svetlichnaya. V. CHORNOVIL Svyatoslav Karavansky. Oksana Popovich. Misha Oksana, Irina Senik, Peter Sichko, Daniel Shumuk, Yuri Shuhevich. Vasyl Romaniuk.</p>
<p>With the rise of UGG in Ukraine first appeared open public organization, which held its operations entirely legal. This was a qualitatively new stage in the development of the opposition movement. But vladaznovu, contrary to their international promises, showed brutality and disregard basic legal norms. By 1980 most of the activists of the Ukrainian Helsinki group found themselves in prisons and camps.</p>
<p>Another form of opposition was religious dissent. Power over seventy years and failed to convert on Soviet society entirely atheistic and therefore had to recognize the right to existence even of the Russian Orthodox Church. Her branch of Kyiv and Ukrainian Galician Metropolis -ohoplyuvala entire territory of the republic. But full accountability to the state of the church, especially the cooperation of the Orthodox clergy from atheistic modes which in itself seemed unnaturally, turned many of its faithful. Under these conditions, increased activity of sects and Protestant churches. Their main centers were abroad, which is why the Soviet authorities treated them with suspicion and otherwise interfered with their activities. The special situation in western Ukraine, where many people despite the officially imposed orthodoxy they secretly remained supporters of the banned Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. In 1982 formed the Committee for the Protection of the UGCC, which aimed to achieve its legalization: In response, the regime arrested activists of the Committee. However, with the subsequent crisis of the communist ideology, the desire of people to religion increased, and the process is out of control state.</p>
<p>In the 1980s it became immediately clear that the resource is exhausted authoritarian rule, and in spite of repression that time from the time used against dissidents, public opposition movement is constantly growing in society zhyvyvsya fatigue of the Soviet way of life and found all new forms of organization.</p>
