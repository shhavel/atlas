<p>Based on the comparison of different image areas (drawings, photographs, plans, maps, etc.), We can conclude that they are thumbnail pictures of the area. However, all of these images differ significantly among themselves. Unlike photos, maps and plans at small and insignificant details do not represent, besides topography transmit using symbols. Thus, the plan area - is reduced, generally, performed using symbols image of a small area of ​​the earth's surface, the curvature of which can be neglected. Geographic same map depicts much larger area and even the entire surface of the Earth. Thus, while it is necessary to consider that the Earth has a spherical shape. Therefore, the image of the spherical earth's surface on a map, which is a plane, some areas have to give a little distorted (slightly compressed or stretched). Exactly how cartographers unable to do so, you will learn when further study of geography.</p>
