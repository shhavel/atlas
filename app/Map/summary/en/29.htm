<p>Agriculture - the second (after the industry) on volume of manufactured products industry in the world economy. It plays a crucial role in providing the population with food and raw materials selected industries.</p>
<p>Agriculture is comprehensive. Use of land resources (farmland), and surface and ground water for irrigation and livestock water needs. Significant impact on the development of agriculture and its specialization have climatic conditions (agroclimatic resources), relief and soil fertility.</p>
<p>The result is a concentration of agricultural specialization of agricultural enterprises the same industry in a certain territory. Objective prerequisites of its formation are favorable natural conditions for the development of certain sectors of agriculture, traditional labor skills of the population of the territory, and the availability of food markets and raw materials. Specialization creates conditions for the intensification of agricultural production - improving productivity through the introduction of scientific and technological progress.</p>
<p>In agriculture are the two main branches: Crop production (farming) and breeding. Other industries (fishing, apiculture, sericulture) play a much smaller role.</p>
<p>Leading sector in most developing countries is the crop. Only some of them prevails livestock. Thus, in the countries of North Africa and Southwest Asia due to poor soils and dry climate crop is almost not developed, and of the livestock industries dominated by sheep and camel.</p>
<p>In highly developed countries is mainly livestock, which provides most of the agricultural production and provide the population of protein food (meat, milk, eggs).</p>
