<p>As seen on the map, the population of the globe taken extremely uneven. Illustrates the population density - the ratio of the population of a given territory to its area (people per km sq.). In addition, the map shows the major cities and agglomerations of the world.</p>
<p>On the globe, about 15% of the land is still not populated, about half of the cultivated areas have population density of less than 5 persons. / Sq km. In addition, in some regions of Southeast Asia at one kilometer territory are 2 000 and more people.</p>
<p>Very different population density and on separate continents. The lowest rate is Australia (less than 3 pers. / Sq km.), The most densely populated Eurasia: on one kilometer of its vast expanses of the average population of about 110 people. Among the most densely populated country is Bangladesh (1100 pers. / Sq km.), And in a country like Mongolia is home to less than 2 people per km. sq.</p>
<p>The average density of the Earth in 1975 was 29, in 1987 - 38, in 1994 - 40, and now about 50 people. per sq km.</p>
<p>Placement of the population has always depended on natural factors (topography, climate). Thus, 80% of humanity lives on the plains that occupy less than a third of the earth's land. Most comfortable for living and economic activity is moderate and subtropical climates, so they are more likely inhabited by people. On the distribution of the population is also influenced by the historical, socio-economic, demographic and other factors. Thus, the most populated regions of the world belong to the territory of ancient agriculture (China Plain, the Indo-Gangetic plain, the valley of the Nile, Japanese island of. Java) and the old industrial regions of Europe and eastern North America. High population density coast of South America, Africa, Australia, that is connected with the history of development of these territories.</p>
<p>Schedule "Population Dynamics of the Earth in the past and forecast the future" is an illustration of the so-called population explosion - rapid population growth. Start boomers, as seen from the graph, it is necessary to XVIII - XIX centuries. This period of the industrial revolution in Western Europe. In the twentieth century. after the collapse of the colonial empires in 50-60 years. the highest population growth rates observed in developing countries, this trend continues today. According to UN projections until the end of the century the population of the planet could reach 10 billion people.</p>
