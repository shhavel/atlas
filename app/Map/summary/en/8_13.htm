<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p>Wallachia - a historical region in Romania between the Carpathians and the Danube. Olt River divides it into two parts: Muntenia, or Wallachia Great from the main city of Bucharest and Oltenia or Lesser Wallachia from the main city of Craiova. In the XIV century. Wallachia was a feudal principality. In Wallachia prevailing monarchical form of political governance led by the warlord, who bore the title of "master."</p>
<p>The territory of Wallachia was the object of constant attacks on the part of Turkey. Since the XVI century. - Under its protectorate. Only as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars of XVIII-XIX centuries. Wallachia was liberated from the Turkish yoke and Adrianople Peace Treaty of 1829 granted it autonomy under the protection of Russia. In 1859 Wallachia united with Moldavia into a single state, called in 1861 Romania.</p>

After the defeat of the Kingdom of Hungary by the Turks in 1541, Transylvania became a principality - a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, paid tribute to the sultan, and had no right to pursue an independent foreign policy. At the same time a part of Transylvania entered the land of the Transcarpathian Ukraine. Since 1687 Transylvania was ruled by the Habsburgs. In 1867 with the formation of the Austro-Hungarian Transylvania is part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Since 1918 - as part of Romania.</p>
<p><b>Resume hostilities. Berestechko battle</b></p>
<p>During 1650 Poland was preparing for a new phase of the war against Bohdan Khmelnytsky.</p>
<p>Military action launched against night February 10th 1651 Crown army led by Hetman Pol'na Martin Kalinowski captured the town of Krasne on the tail. In the fierce fighting killed nearly all the Cossacks Bratslav Regiment.</p>
<p>From the Krasny of Kalinowski moved to the winery, intending to make it a reference point for further offensive in late February and have already started the siege. However, the battle of headquarters were unsuccessful Poles and significantly weakened the army Kalinowski.</p>
<p>Decisive battles between the main forces of Polish and Ukrainian armies took place 18-30 June 1651 near the town. Berestechko in Volyn. The place was chosen for the battle between the rivers Stir and Plyashivky. The morning of June 18 broke the first fight.</p>
<p>Berestechko battle was the largest battle of the National Liberation War in number of soldiers who took part in it.</p>
<p>During the main battle, June 20, when the advantage was already on the side of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Horde suddenly left the battlefield, as it turned out, the Crimean Khan Islam-“êirey would not defeat the Polish army, because the day before began negotiations with the King.</p>
<p>To protect Cossack forces from crushing defeat, Khmelnytsky decided to withdraw the army to the district. Plyashivky, swamp shores which could reliably protect the rear of the Cossack troops. And ordered to build earthworks to strengthen the camp, Hetman went for Khan to achieve a return bands on the battlefield. But Khan actually shut Bohdan Khmelnytsky.</p>
<p>Within 10 days the Cossacks heroically defending the camp, beating all the attacks of the Poles.</p>
<p>Clerk was elected hetman Ivan Bohun. Council decided to break out of the encirclement.</p>
<p>Check out the main part of the efficient Cossack troops occurred at night compared to 30 June. Cossacks built a crossing Plyashivku and unnoticed by enemy out of the environment. Knowing that the Cossacks left camp Jan Kazimierz immediately sent back corona unit troops. Those Cossacks who covered the retreat of the main force, died a heroic death.</p>
<p>So Berestechko battle for Cossacks was unsuccessful. However, to consider it complete defeat no reason. Because there was no surrender, there was defeat Cossack army, much of which deliver decisive action Bohun.</p>
<p><b>BILOTSERKIVSKA peace treaty September 18, 1651 at the White Church</b></p>
<p>The territory of the Hetman government limited the Kyiv province.</p>
<p>By Bratslav and Chernigov provinces returned Polish administration.</p>
<p>The magnates and gentry received their pre-war estates.</p>
<p>Cossack Registry was reduced from 40 to 20 thousand.</p>
<p><b>The reasons for making</b></p>
<p>Easily achieved noticeable loss Ukrainian Berestechko and under Turnip - from the Lithuanian army.</p>
<p>Capture the enemy most of the territory of the Hetmanate.</p>
<p>The uncertainty of the position of the Crimean Khan.</p>
<p>The intensification of the contradictions between the Cossacks and officers.</p>
<p>Pressure on the Hetman of those officers who wished to conclude a truce with Poland.</p>
<p><b>FIRST TRIP, Moldavia Bogdan Khmelnitsky</b></p>
<p>In order to achieve military and political isolation of Poland Bogdan Khmelnitsky in the early 1650s. Tried to strike up relationships with the Danube countries - Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia, too.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1648, Hetman resorted to trying to persuade the Moldavian master Vasile Lupu good neighborly relations with Hetmanate.</p>
<p>However, Lupul continue to support the Polish government that Moldova planned to use in its fight against the rebels.</p>
<p>In the second half of August 1650 60000th Ukrainian army led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky and 30 thousand Crimean Tatars crossed the Dniester and entered the territory of the Moldavian principality.</p>
<p>In early September 1650 the Cossack regiments captured the capital of the principality - m. Yassamy. Vasile Lupu agreed to a peace, which was the main condition for the waiver from the union of Moldavia and Poland. So between Ukraine and Moldova was found alliance. To strengthen political ties with the Hetmanate, the Moldavian master undertook to give his daughter Rozanda a son of Bogdan Khmelnitsky - Timosha.</p>
<p>However, after the battle Berestetska Vasile Lupu refused to comply with their commitments to Ukraine. Remind me about this condition the Ukraine-Moldova agreement Khmelnytsky decided by force of arms. Hetman has prepared a new campaign against Moldova.</p>
<p><b>BATOZKA BATTLE</b></p>
<p>Not wanting to admit military union with Moldova Ukraine, the Polish government ordered the Grand Crown Hetman M.Kalynovskomu oppose Ukrainian regiments that came from Podneprovye to Moldova.</p>
<p>Polish troops encamped at Mount Whip Bratslavshchina (modern Vinnichchina), on the right bank of the Southern Bug.</p>
<p>May 22, 1652 advanced Cossack troops under the command Timosha Khmelnytsky and Tatar cavalry units began to fight with the Polish cavalry, and the main part came quietly on 23 May.</p>
<p>By surrounding the Polish camp, Ukrainian army attacked simultaneously from all sides. Bohdan Khmelnytsky advantage failures Poles, waiting for help, built a very large camp, which they could not protect existing forces.</p>
<p>By evening, the Polish army was completely broken, lost and his commander in chief. Having learned of the defeat at the whip, the Polish army, which went to the rescue Kalinovski turned back.</p>
<p>Tactics Bogdan Khmelnitsky in Batozkiy battle contemporaries compared with the classical model of military tactics to encircle and destroy the enemy forces applied Carthaginian commander Hannibal regarding the Roman army in the Battle of Cannes 216 BC. E. e.</p>
<p><b>Place Batozkoyi battle in the deployment of the national liberation struggle</b></p>
<p>Winning the Cossacks in Batih was retaliation for the defeat Berestechko.</p>
<p>It has contributed to the deployment of rebellion Bratslavshchina and Chernihiv restored to the Polish authorities.</p>
<p>The invaders were forced to flee and leave the land Hetmanate western border which once again established on the banks of the river. Sluch as envisaged agreement Zborowski 1649</p>
<p>As a result, a new outbreak of the liberation struggle in May-June 1652 resumed power's government, and the Cossack Ukraine regained its independence. Bilotserkivskiy contract became ineffective.</p>
<p><b>Moldovan hiking 1652-1653 biennium.</b></p>
<p>After Batozkoyi battles in May and June 1652, the Ukrainian army, entering Moldavia forced Lupul fulfill prior commitments. In August Tymish taken marry Rozanda.</p>
<p>Concerned Ukrainian-Moldovan Union, Poland, Wallachia and Transylvania were united in anti-Ukrainian coalition. In April 1653 Matthew Basarab Wallachian owner and Transylvanian Prince George (Dyerd) II R√°k√≥czi, with the support of the Polish government seized Iasi and was put on the throne of his protege. Vasile Lupu enlisted the help of Bohdan Khmelnytsky.</p>
<p>21-22 April 1653 Ukrainian army, headed Timosha Khmelnytsky defeated the troops of the new Moldavian master. The government again passed to Lupul. However, bold face Lupul yet vdovolnyvsya. He encouraged Timosha Khmelnytsky expedition to Wallachia. Tymish not refuse the test. But the trip was unsuccessful. Tymofiy Khmelnytsky with his army returned to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Military assistance Lupul did not stop contention for power in Moldova. Soon Lupul again put off the throne. Got in trouble, he once again enlisted the help of the Cossacks. Faithful allied obligations Ukrainian army, led by Timosha, went hiking. Circumstances were not in favor Timosha. The fortress of Suceava Cossacks came under siege. During the heroic defense Timosha was mortally wounded.</p>
<p><b>Battle of Zhvanets</b></p>
<p>Batozka victory does not mean a quick end to a war against Poland. From February 1653 Polish troops carried out devastating raids on Cossack territory.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1653 the Polish King 40-thousand army went out of the city to Galich, and then - to Kamenets-Podolsk and camped near the town Zhvanets, between the rivers Dniester and Zhvanchyk.</p>
<p>There came also the main force of Ukrainian-Tatar army. Polish camp was taken in a long siege that exhausted the enemy army. The Polish camp of famine, epidemic broke out. And the final defeat of the Poles has once again saved the Horde.</p>
<p>December 5 Khan and King of Poland concluded an oral agreement under which hostilities ceased, the Tatars were permitted to yasyr at Western. The interests of the territory of Ukraine for the agreement were not taken into account because it provided for the restoration of conditions of contract Zborivsky not suited Ukrainian.</p>
<p><b>Thus, despite the successful military operations, the effects Zhvanetskiy campaign for the Ukrainian Hetmanate were extremely unfavorable.</b></p>
<p><b>Internal and international position Hetmanate END OF 1653</b></p>
<p>Given the protracted war situation of the Ukrainian state steadily deteriorated.</p>
<p>Especially hard it was autumn 1653 Six years of war exhausted Ukraine. As a result of Polish punitive campaigns, Horde robberies, permanent mobilization of the population, epidemics of plague and cholera was devastated more than 100 cities and towns on the Right Bank, znelyudnily territory Bratslavshchina and Kyiv.</p>
<p>Fallen agriculture. Impoverished Cossacks could no longer perform military service. More difficult were mobilizing. For example, during the mobilization in August and September 1653 Khmelnytsky managed to collect only 30-40 thousand. Troops. Increasing fatigue and frustration of the people. Escaping from invaders, Ukrainian fled to Muscovy and the Slobidska. We started riots flare peasants and ordinary Cossacks against the policy's government.</p>
<p>International situation worsened and the Ukrainian state. Rzeczpospolita, Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania were united in anti-Ukrainian Union. Crimean khan too often at crucial moments betrayed Ukrainian, so an alliance with him seemed uncertain. As for Poland, it is not resigned to the existence of a Ukrainian state, preparing for a new offensive.</p>
<p>To preserve the main achievements of the war, first state, the Ukrainian government has concluded that the need to resort to an alliance with the Muscovite tsar or the Turkish sultan. It is in this direction picked diplomacy's government.</p>
