<p>Considering the physical map of the hemispheres, especially pay attention to the grid Degree. It is known to be formed by meridians and parallels. Meridian - an imaginary line, formed by the cross-sectional plane of the earth's surface that passes through the Earth's axis. Parallels - an imaginary line, formed by the cross-section of the earth's surface planes perpendicular (at an angle of 90 °) to the Earth's axis. And the meridians and parallels are imaginary lines on the ground because they can not see. However plotted on a globe or map they play an important role. In addition, we can decide how often will hold these lines, depending on the scope and purpose of a map or globe. Easy to see that all meridians are identical to each other, because they connect the same point - the poles. Parallels unlike meridians - all different to each other. The farther from the pole, the more they will be longer. The biggest parallel is the equator - the line equidistant from the poles. At its equator almost as long as any of the meridians, about 40 000 km.</p>
<p>With parallels determine latitude anywhere. Latitude - is the angle between the plane of the equator and a line passing through a point to the center of the Earth. Because through any point can draw parallels, to determine its latitude in degrees sufficient to calculate the angular distance from the equator (it is the reference latitude) parallel to a given point. Equator divides the globe into two hemispheres - North and South. Latitude is also the northern (abbreviated mo. W.) And South (DR. W.). Latitude equator - 0 °. Geographic poles are latitude 90 °.</p>
<p>Longitude points determined by meridians. Longitude - is the angle between the plane of the initial meridian and the meridian of the point. According to the original approved meridian passing through the astronomical observatory in the town Ґrynvich, near the capital of the United Kingdom - London. This is called the zero meridian (it has a longitude 0 °) or Ґrynvitskym. Ґrynvitskyy meridian divides the globe into Western and Eastern hemispheres. Countdown longitudes are west and east of the initial meridian, as well as longitude is west (p. E.) And eastern (c. F.), And can not exceed 180 °.</p>
<p>A degree in any of the meridians corresponds approximately 111.3 km on the ground. The same is the case and at the equator. On the other parallels distance on the ground that corresponds to 1 ° map decreases towards the equator to the poles. Since the length of one degree of arc parallels 10 ° is 109.6 km, parallel 50 ° (approximate latitude of Kyiv and Kharkiv) - 71.7 km.</p>
<p>Geographic at any point of the globe is its geographic coordinates, which are latitude and longitude are expressed in degrees. Interestingly, there are two specific points that have only latitude and longitude are not. This - the geographic poles. Take a good look at the map of the hemispheres and think how to explain this?</p>
