<p>Mongol-Tatars. Warriors of Genghis Khan, the Mongols called themselves. Ruski same chroniclers called them Tatars, not knowing that the latter had to suffer the same Mongol bows and swords. In the 19th century. historical scholarship has been extended term "Mongol-Tatars" which, however, recently in the scientific literature hardly used. However, in textbooks it posluhovuyutsya in order to make it more clear that historic documents where most of the Mongol invaders called Tatars.</p>
<p>Horde - army of nomads, and the place where the rate was Khan.</p>
<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. The rise of the Mongolian state and its aggressive policy. Battle of the Kalka River</b></p>
<p>At the end of the 12th century. in the steppes of Central Asia, formed a powerful military-feudal Mongolian state.</p>
<p>Year 1206 Khan of all Mongolia was proclaimed Temujin (Genghis Khan).</p>
<p>He started to perform aggressive policy, which resulted in 1221 was conquered Central Asia and Khorezm.</p>
<p>In 1222 the Mongols invaded through the Caucasus to the Black Sea steppes and defeated at the Battle of Polovtsy Don.</p>
<p>Polovtsian Khan Kotyan retreated to the Dnieper and enlisted the help of Russian princes.</p>
<p>The congress of princes in Kiev was decided to perform together with polovtsy against the Mongols. In April 1223 his wife went to the march of Russian princes who were led by Mstislav Romanovich Kyiv, Mstislav Mstislavovich Udaloi Galician and Mstislav of Chernigov Svyatoslavich.</p>
<p>The battle with the main forces of the Mongols took place May 31, 1223 on the river Kalka.</p>
<p>Galician and Volyn wife of Prince Mstislav Udatnoho and Prince Daniel Romanovich and Cumans crossed Kalka and began the battle without waiting for the other princes.</p>
<p>Polovtsi fled from the battlefield, causing disorder in the army of Rus. This advantage of the Mongols and defeated them.</p>
<p>After that surrounded the camp Horde wife prince of Kiev Mstislav Romanovich, which stood on the right bank of the river and did not participate in the battle.</p>
<p>After the three-day assault, unable to overcome the resistance and capture the camp, the Mongols proposed a truce. When peace terms were accepted and princely retinue left the camp, they waited for death.</p>
<p>Loss of Russian troops were huge, Ruthenian only every tenth soldier, who took part in the campaign, he returned home.</p>
<p>However, the Mongols suffered heavy losses. That year they decided not to continue the campaign into the heart of Russia, and turned back.</p>
<p>Going to Russia led by Genghis Khan's grandson Batu.</p>
<p>Batu's horde marched on Russian lands at the end of 1237</p>
<p>During the 1237-1238 biennium. Was destroyed by the troops of Ryazan and Vladimir-Suzdal princes.</p>
<p>The Mongols took by storm and burned Ryazan, Vladimir, Moscow, Tver and other cities. North-Eastern was devastated.</p>
<p><b>2. Hike the Mongols in the south-western Russian lands</b></p>
<p>After a successful campaign in the north-eastern Russian lands, the Mongol hordes in 1238 depleted a thing of the Polovtsian steppe to renew strength and rest.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1239 they moved to the southwest.</p>
<p>The first on the way to Batu bands was Pereyaslav. The Mongols captured the city, destroyed and burned it.</p>
<p>That same year, a sad fate befell Chernigov.</p>
<p>At the end of 1239 Mongolian cavalry vderlasya in Crimea, in pursuit of the vanquished her Polovtsian. The invaders have captured almost the entire peninsula.</p>
<p>In early 1240 the rest of the Mongol army approached Kyiv. As the chronicler informs Mongolian warlord Menhuhan sent to the prince of Kiev - Kiev then on the table sat Michael Vsevolod of Chernigov - messengers from the requirement to surrender the city.</p>
<p>Prince Michael ordered to kill the messengers, and he - or frightened by his own act, or knowing that there is adequate support - went to Hungary.</p>
<p>However, expression of defiance that time ceased capital city: Menhuhan dared with those forces that they had to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Seized booty and prisoners in the surrounding villages, he went to join up with the main forces of Batu.</p>
<p>However, in late 1240 the Mongols again approached and surrounded the city of Kyiv.</p>
<p>In Kyiv then extended his rule Daniel Galician. So the defense of the city fell to the Mongol invasion to take care of chief captain of Prince Daniel - Dmitriy.</p>
<p>Prince himself went to Poland and Hungary, intending to organize neighbors on joint action against the invaders.</p>
<p><b>3. The defense of Kyiv</b></p>
<p>According to one chronicle list, taking Kyiv Mongols held on Mykola's Day or December 6th, 1240</p>
<p>Otherwise, the list never given any dates, but only said that the city was kept for 10 weeks and four days.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that Kyiv had extremely powerful fortress, scientists tend to believe that the siege was long and assault - hardened.</p>
<p>The main challenge Batu walked from the south in the area Lyadsky gate.</p>
<p>Continuously, day and night Mongols beat rams the gates and walls, until captured portion of the shaft and not burst the limits of "the city of Yaroslav."</p>
<p>Resistance Kyivers was so desperate and losing invaders so large that Batu had to order a halt fighting and gave respite to his army.</p>
<p>This advantage of the defenders of Kyiv. Stepping on the verge "of Vladimir", they overnight robust to new positions.</p>
<p>The next day the battle began again. Kiyani vigorously defended every street, every house, but the forces were too unequal.</p>
<p>The Mongols broke through the fortifications in the vicinity of the Sofia gate - because they later became known as Batu.</p>
<p>The invaders surrounded the Church of the Tithes and hit her wall murolomnymy machines.</p>
<p>The temple collapsed, buried under the ruins of its heroic defenders. Thousands of people of Kiev were killed in an unequal struggle.</p>
<p>Almost all residential and commercial buildings, palaces and churches Kyiv turned into ashes.</p>
<p>Because more than 40 temples of stone that had to Kyiv Mongolian trampling, according to scientists left, and and it is very damaged, some 5-6.</p>
<p>Because of over 8 thousand. Yards, according to Plano Carpini, preserved about 200 Consequently, the inhabitants "mother of Russian cities" decreased from 50 - 60 and two thousand.</p>
<p><b>4. Hike Mongol hordes in Galicia and Volhynia</b></p>
<p>From Kyiv core strength Batu moved to Vladimir and Galich, while other Mongol units were plunder Kyiv region.</p>
<p>With fire and sword the Mongols were in Kyiv, Volyn and Galicia lands.</p>
<p>Excavations Vishgorod and Belgorod, settlements on grouse, happened, Horyn, Southern Bug rivers and other pictures reflect the heroic defense and destruction of these cities.</p>
<p>Long and fierce battle was for Vladimir.</p>
<p>The enemy of the great difficulty took the city.</p>
<p>Under the Mongol hordes came Galich combined forces after a three-day siege took it by storm.</p>
<p>Year 1241, the Mongols reached the western borders of Russia.</p>
<p>Part vderlasya Mongol army in Poland.</p>
<p>But the main Mongol force entered the boundaries of Hungary and moved to the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>However, in 1242, Batu stopped the campaign in the West and in Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Russia withdrew its troops in the lower reaches of the Volga.</p>
<p>The reason for this was the death of the main Mongol Khan Ogedei, Batu and wanted to take an active part in the election of a new one.</p>
<p>However, the reasons for termination of the campaign were deeper: Batu had no power to hold in subjection all the conquered countries of Eastern and Central Europe, especially heavy losses suffered his army.</p>
<p><b>5. Golden yoke</b></p>
<p>Mongol Empire was redistributed into four parts (ulus).</p>
<p>Batu possession were the westernmost part - Jochi Ulus: it was created by the state Golden Horde.</p>
<p>Under the authority of the state, covering territory from the Urals and Western Siberia to the Black Sea, was all Rus-Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mongol invasion of Rus lands has changed beyond recognition. The greatest devastation suffered Kiev, Chernigov and Pereyaslavskoe-Seversky Principality.</p>
<p>After the hike Batu they become dependent on the Golden Horde.</p>
<p>Duke Power in these lands remained, but the right to rule the Mongol Khan confirmed their label - Diploma-permission to land - in exchange for recognition of their superiority and obligation to provide him an army and pay tribute.</p>
<p>According to sources, the Mongols demanded payment of the total population of the ten - as food and property, and their own people.</p>
<p>By terrible "human tithe" hit those who could not pay normally. Removed people fall into slavery, most of them donated to the Mongolian army.</p>
<p>For the calculation and collection of tribute watched Mongolian officials. Senior government officials on the conquered lands called Baskakov.</p>
<p>In his possession were troops that were constantly in fortified settlements - baskatskomu town. The researchers suggest that one of these towns located near Kyiv in Batu tract - where interprets a stored still name.</p>
<p>All conquered lands under Mongol custom, was redistributed into parts (ulus) between subordinates Batu less powerful khans.</p>
<p>Thus, the Dnieper region was redistributed between the khans and Mautsi Kuremsy: first wandered into Zadneprovye second - step right bank.</p>
<p>Golden rulers constantly interfering in the internal affairs of the principalities, fanning wars between princes, without stopping, and before the destruction of the princes who came to the Horde capital.</p>
<p>So, when Prince Michael of Chernigov Vsevolod attempted to establish itself in Kiev, he had to turn to Khan.</p>
<p>The chronicler informs that Prince Michael went to the Horde by Khan's label, where September 20, 1246 for refusing to perform pagan rituals on orders Batu was executed along with his boyar Fedor.</p>
<p>In 1243 the first of the princes acknowledged the supremacy of the Mongols and took a shortcut on city Kyiv Yaroslav and Vladimir Vsevolod.</p>
<p>However, until destroyed Kyiv prince did not go, but sent out the governor.</p>
<p>After the death of Yaroslav Vsevolodovicha right "to Kyiv and all Rus' land" was his son Alexander, called the Nevsky. But he refused, and the capital.</p>
<p>Pereyaslavskaya land fell into even greater dependence on the Horde. In the second half of the 40's. 13 in. there was not her prince.</p>
<p>Lost its former greatness and Chernihiv principality. From the late 13th - during the first half of the 14th century. it was divided into more and more portions.</p>
<p><b>6. Mongol supremacy over Halych-Volhynia</b></p>
<p>Compared to the other n lands less devastation of the Mongol invasion suffered Galicia-Volyn principality.</p>
<p>It was not redistributed by the Mongols into administrative districts as other principalities, was not there and governors-Baskakov.</p>
<p>In Galicia and Volhynia was ruled by its own princes able to continue his association Ukrainian principalities.</p>
<p>Not the last role played here and prominent figure of the ruler of Galicia-Volyn principality - Prince Daniel Romanovich.</p>
<p>Its actions displeased Batu, who set out to visit the Prince requirement Horde.</p>
<p>In October 1245 Daniel went to the Horde.</p>
<p>The trip was long. According to the Chronicle, Daniel stayed in Horde 25 days.</p>
<p>Pursuant to negotiations Mongols adopted him Galician-Volyn prince:</p>
<p>Payment of tribute was not provided, and the dependence of Galicia-Volyn principality from the Golden Horde was the Prince's troops participating in the campaigns of the Mongol army.</p>
<p><b>Thus, although Danylo was in a dependence on Batu, Mongolian those in power was still far from complete subjugation Galician-Volyn lands.</b></p>
<p><b>7. Implications Golden Yoke</b></p>
<p>To fully assess the impact of the Mongol invasion of Ukrainian lands, we should remember that it is not only destructive campaigns 1238-1242 gg., But also - and mainly it! - A century of being under the rule of the Mongol khans.</p>
<p>The enormous human and material losses they suffered Ukrainian principality in the first - the most powerful impact, over the years have grown since the Mongol hordes from time to time the waves rolled on conquered lands predatory wars.</p>
<p>The researchers note that during these raids Ukrainian lands lost princes, priests, artisans, soldiers, and it inflicted great damage to the evolution of the people, retarded economic and cultural life.</p>
<p>The loss of political independence, the performance of the princes as obedient executor of the will of the Golden captains prytlumlyuvaly state-tradition that was given felt for centuries to come.</p>
<p>After weakening due to the Mongol invasion of Rus rushed to take advantage of Western neighbors, especially Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Teutonic Order, and bleeding Ukrainian lands were not doable to appropriate support.</p>
<p>This eventually led to the division of Ukrainian lands among several states - and this is the most tragic consequence Golden hardship.</p>
