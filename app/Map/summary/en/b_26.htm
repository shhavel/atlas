<p>Steel - one of the basic industries in many countries. The production process in the steel industry consists of a number of successive productions. The initial stage is the production of iron and manganese ore, coking coal and non-metallic materials. This is followed by enrichment of ores and coke, pig iron and steel manufacturing and rolled alloys. Steel was very resource-industry (to produce one ton of steel is used more than 6 tons of raw materials, fuel and auxiliary materials). Therefore, the steel plants are located mainly along with iron ore and coal basins. Thus the steel parts of Russia (Ural, Kuznetsk), Ukraine (Donetsk, Pridneprovsky), Germany (Ruhr), Poland (Verhnosylezkyy), USA (Pennsylvania), China and India.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of the location of ferrous metals at the present stage is customer orientation and freight materials, ie - location near major markets or near major transportation hubs. That's metallurgical enterprises are located in Japan, South Korea, Italy, new factories in Germany, France, USA and Russia.</p>
<p>The largest producers of steel is China, USA, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Ukraine, India. Performance steelmaking per capita is the highest in European countries (Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Ukraine) and in Japan.</p>
<p>For small European countries are characterized by the creation of specialized mini-mills that produce high-quality steel and rolled metal complex and metal processing companies (using scrap).
