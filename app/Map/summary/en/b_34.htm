<p>Transport - an important part of the economy of any country. It is the basis of international geographical division of labor, providing manufacturing and nonmanufacturing needs of the economy and the population in all types of traffic.</p>
<p>The main technical and economic indicators of transport are traffic volumes, freight turnover (the product of the volume of traffic on distance), passenger, speed, pratsemistkist, transportation costs, bandwidth lines, flexibility, depending on the weather and seasonal changes. Different modes of transport have their advantages and disadvantages, so use them depending on specific conditions.</p>
<p>The main modes are: land (rail, road), water (sea, river, lake) and others (pipeline, air, electronic).</p>
<p>Railway operates in 160 countries, ranking the second highest turnover (following sea) and passenger (after the motor). Railways reflects the economic situation. With the growth of the economy increased turnover and increase the speed and intensity of trains. Due to the increasing electrification of road ecology, the adverse impact of transport on the environment. Leaders in the length of railways is a large country: USA, Canada, Russia, India and China. The highest density of railways in Europe and Japan. Least-developed rail transport in Africa.</p>
<p>Road transport is the most maneuverable (transportation of cargo and passengers from gate to gate). Length of roads is growing. In 2002 it amounted to 25 million km. In developed countries become widespread highways - speed highway Superior. Maximum length of roads with the US, Japan and Western Europe.</p>
<p>Rapidly developing pipelines. The network of oil and gas pipelines is presented on a map of the oil and gas industry. Modern scientific and technological advances make it possible to lay submarine pipelines. The longest of these is a Mediterranean gas pipeline connecting Algeria to Italy.</p>
<p>Maritime transport serves mainly international trade. About half its tonnage accounts for oil and petroleum products. Major waterways run through the Atlantic Ocean and off the coast of Southeast Asia. The largest port in the world: Shanghai (freight turnover 379 million tons / year), Singapore, Rotterdam, New York, Philadelphia, Marseille, London. The most intense areas of sea routes are sea channels: Suez (Egypt), Panama, Kiel (Germany).</p>
<p>River and lake transport is particularly important in Russia, USA and Canada. The main navigable rivers of the world is the Mississippi from Missouri, Rhine, Danube, Dnieper, Parana Mekon“ë more.</p>
<p>Air transport has the highest cost of transport, but the pace of development ahead of all other traffic. Especially it is important for countries with a large territory and the presence of inaccessible areas and in international passenger traffic. In terms of air transport are leading the US, Japan, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia. Major airports in the world are represented on this map. Most passengers take the airport in Atlanta and Chicago (USA) - every year more than 70 million passengers each.</p>
