<p>Ukraine in the period of post-war reconstruction (1944 - 1953 gg.)</p>
<p>The liberation of the territory of Soviet Ukraine's borders in June 22, 1941 ended October 8, 1944, however its arrangement began long before this day.</p>
<p>Back in 1943 the evacuation began returning civilians, rebuilt and restored the activity of the enterprise, especially in Eastern Ukraine. Moreover, major efforts have focused on heavy industry and energy. If in 1943 there were only 1/5 indestructible industrial enterprises, over the period to 1950 by extraordinary exertion already bled white by war republic industrial output reached pre-war levels and even exceeded it.</p>
<p>During the war, Ukraine has lost about 9 million people. On average in each of the areas remained between 50 and 70% of the prewar population. The demographic situation even more complicated famine 1946 - 1947 years, caused by crop failure, negligent leadership in agriculture and traditionally rigid and suspicious attitude of communism to the peasantry. Famine swept the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine and cost over 1 million lives.</p>
<p>After the war significantly changed the ethnic structure of the population of Ukraine. The country remained Germans, was completely destroyed in the post-war Jewish population and the Jewish Community of Ukraine consisted only of those who have returned from evacuation. Instead, began to increase dramatically the proportion of Russians. A lot of Russian workers came to rebuild the heavy industry of Donbass, and then stayed there forever. Hard shocks experienced Crimea. The joy of victory there for many turned into a tragedy no less than the German occupation. Taking advantage of the war, the Soviet leadership navazhylosya finally release the attractive peninsula of land from unwanted indigenous population. In May 1944, just from the Crimea was broken last Nazis, a large-scale operation of the forced deportation of the Crimean Tatars and other nationalities: Greeks, Bulgarians, Armenians, only about 225 thousand. People. To exempt lands so settlers came from the central regions of Russia.</p>
<p>The ethnic situation in the Western Ukraine directly dependent on the settlement of border issues. By agreement of the leadership of the Soviet Union, the government revived the Polish border between the two countries had almost prolyahty "Curzon Line" proposed as a line Ukrainian-Polish distinction in December 1919 Poland finally abandoning the Western lands, receiving territorial compensation in the west by defeated Germany. However, in Poland remained inhabited Ukrainian Podlasie, Kholmshchyna Nadsyannya and Lemkivschyna. Finally, the boundary line established agreement of 16 August 1945. With respect to the border in 1941, the Soviet Union refused to Poland on the territory Nadsyannya cities Lubaczow and Przemysl (Przemysl). When the Soviet-Polish agreement envisaged exchange of populations: Poles in Western Ukraine had to move to Poland and from Ukrainian territories that remained in Poland - to the USSR. In 1947 Ukraine had left more than 800 thousand. Poles. They settled mostly in the newly annexed to Poland Silesia and Pomerania, where forcibly evicted nearly 6 million Germans. For example, the Polish community of the city almost completely moved to Wroclaw (Breslau German). In Ukraine, voluntarily, and mostly by force, moved about 500 thousand. Ukrainian.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1947 in the Polish Subcarpathian (Lemko) was still 150 thousand Ukrainian. Under no circumstances they did not want to leave his father's land. Against this population was used the most brutal events. In the spring of 1947 the Polish and Soviet leadership was planned and implemented deportation "Operation Vistula". Area of ​​residence was locked Ukrainian Polish, Soviet and Czech-Slovak troops, after which the Polish army units and by the KGB started "cleaning" areas. During the operation was suppressed desperate resistance groups UPA killed more than 10 thousand. Civilians. The rest of the Ukrainian forcibly moved away from the Soviet border - in Silesia, Pomerania, East Prussia. Other specification of the Soviet-Polish border took place in February 1951 in the USSR went rich deposits of coal border region with cities and Belz Chervonograd (Hrystynopil), while Poland received the Carpathian region of the San verhorichchi town Ustrzyki Dolne (Ustshyky-partite). The consequence of large-scale deportations and population transfer was that ethnic Ukrainian-Polish border actually coincides with the state border.</p>
<p>International recognition of the rights of the Soviet Union to Western Ukraine Ukrainian liberation movement has put in a very difficult situation. Further armed struggle became futile, and after death March 5, 1950 the commander of the UPA Shukhevych insurgency has been reduced to isolated actions of guerrilla groups in the Carpathian foothills and underground groups in urban areas. Within a few years, their activities faded.</p>
<p>In June 1945 in the USSR entered Transcarpathia. In October 1944 region was liberated from German-Hungarian troops. Formally Carpathian Ruthenia was to return to Czechoslovakia, but in fact it was ruled by the Soviet military administritsiyi. Finally Czech-Slovak leadership was forced to accept the loss of territory.</p>
<p>When the Soviet-Romanian agreement on February 10, 1947 between the two countries was set boundary defined yet 1940 Northern Bukovina and Southern Bessarabia again came to the USSR as Chernivtsi and Izmail region. Recover Moldavian SSR. So in a totalitarian regime most of the Ukrainian ethnolinguistic area were collected within a single administrative-territorial formation - Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The truth of the Ukrainian array was ever divorced his Western (Podlasie, Kholmshchyna Nadsyannya and Lemkivschyna) and eastern (Eastern Sloboda, Kuban) margin.</p>
