<p><b>Basic concepts and terms</b></p>
<p>Archaeology - the science that studies the history of society on the material remains of the life and activity of people - real (archaeological) sights, explores some vintage items and facilities offered by the archaeological excavations, based on which the story is played ages who have little or no highlight written sources.</p>
<p><b>Note!</b></p>
<p>The richest material for studying the ancestors of people found in Africa. Archaeological finds confirm the appearance of there creatures called Australopithecus, more than 5 million years ago. Australopithecus find monkeys who stood on the threshold of humanization, because they have features that alike with their man, upright posture; greater than in monkeys, the average volume of the brain; much more than in monkeys, the ratio of brain weight to the weight of the whole body; significant contrast between the thumb another and so on. The remains of the oldest Australopithecus found in oz.Turkana in Kenya -His age 5,5-5,0 million years. Last australopithecines are aged 850 thousand. Years.</p>
<p>The oldest human scientists believe prezyndzhantropa or homo habilisa - Homo habilis, appeared not later than 3 million years ago and disappeared to 1.1 million years ago. By prezyndzhantropa people enrolled on the basis of the first signs of labor inherent, because along with the bones of the living creatures were discovered and artificial tools.</p>
<p>Next step anthropogenes associated with the appearance of Pithecanthropus or Homo erectus - a man with erect posture. According to scientists, there Pithecanthropus 1,5-1,0 million years ago. Finds their rather numerous and found in various parts of the world. Apes had a height of 150-180 cm, the average brain volume was greater than in Australopithecus. Their hands were more skilled, as evidenced by improved and more diverse weapon Par≈£a. They settled in caves or do some primitive home alone.</p>
<p>Prezyndzhantropiv apes and unite the code name archanthropines.</p>
<p>Even more closer to the man in the modern sense of the Neanderthals. The earliest period of their findings dated 150-100 thousand. Years ago. As for human beings, Neanderthal was a little lower than the growth of modern man, but celebrated hardihood. The volume of brain volume reaches the brain of modern man, but retained many archaic features: the development of the superciliary arches and the back of the combined low sloping forehead. This is indicative of underdeveloped frontal fractions of the brain responsible for complex thinking, as well as the city center of inhibitory processes. Therefore, as researchers believe that Neanderthals were incapable of abstract thinking, their distinctive features - irritability and aggressiveness. Neanderthals and complexity of the problem is that the last of them lived up to the time of the modern human physical type.</p>
<p>In fact, researchers believe such a person Cro-Magnon, the remains of which were first discovered in 1868 in the southwest of France. Modern science says that with the advent of Cro-Magnon complete the formation of the modern man. It happened around 40 thousand years ago.</p>
<p><b>Periodization of Ancient History of Ukraine (archaeological)</b></p>
<p>Stone Age</p>
<p>Paleolithic or old stone age lasted from 1 million to 10 thousand. Years ago. It is divided into</p>
<ul>
<li>early (1 million - 150 thousand.)</li>
<li>average (150 ths. - 40-35 thousand).</li>
<li>late (40 thousand. - 10 thousand.) - the era of the emergence and existence of modern human type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mesolithic or middle stone age in Ukraine lasted from 10 thousand. Years to 7 thousand. Years ago.</p>
<p>Neolithic Stone Age - from 7 th. To 5 thousand. Years ago.</p>
<p>Copper-Bronze Age</p>
<p>Chalcolithic, copper-stone - 4 - 3 mill. Bronze - from start to beginning 2 1 mill.</p>
<p>Iron Age (early) - the beginning of the first millennium BC. (9 cent. BC - 4th century AD.)</p>
<p><b>1. The emergence and settlement pralyudey in Ukraine. Life archanthropinae early Paleolithic period</b></p>
<p>Men first appeared in Ukraine about 1 million years ago. The oldest monument in Ukraine there is parking near the village of Queen Vinogradov District in Transcarpathia.</p>
<p>On the left bank of the Tisa, on the terrace height of 100-120 meters, archaeologists have discovered a unique archaeological finds, the many stone tools - are covered with pebbles, hand axes, hostrokonechnyky, scrapers, edge Rohatyn, knives.</p>
<p>Bone ancient inhabitants of Ukraine so far reveal no luck. But scientists believe that it was archanthropines. They came to the territory of Europe from Africa at the beginning of glaciation. The climate was still mild, but already felt the cold breath of the glacier.</p>
<p>For archanthropinae was characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of fire, but they could not produce it.</li>
<li>Tools were made of stone shaking.</li>
<li>Main tools - hand axes, which could push, cut, cut.</li>
<li>In stone, used wooden tools, such as spears, pointed the way to the end of the burning fire.</li>
<li>They lived in large groups - herds. They do not build homes, constantly moving in search of food. In those times in our area have had a lot of heat-loving plants. So the ancient inhabitants of the Ukrainian lands nourished by their fruits, shoots, roots. Eaten as meat, hunting for deer, antelope, horses, bulls, elephants, rhinos, hippos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traces activity archanthropinae found near the village Rokosovo in Transcarpathia, near the villages of Luka Vrublovetska and Babin on the Dniester and Amvrosiyivka in the Donbass, in the foothills of the Crimea and more.</p>
<p>Zalyudnennya territory of Ukraine was the Balkans and Central Europe. However, some scientists believe probable paths and through the Caucasus.</p>
<p><b>2. Mastering pralyudmy territory of Ukraine for the Middle Paleolithic. Paleanthropines (Neanderthals), classes and starts the spiritual life</b></p>
<p>Archaeological finds that they belong to the time of 150-40 thousand. Years ago, proving a big change in the life of primitive people.</p>
<p>The next step after archanthropinae humanizing our distant ancestors were paleanthropines or Neanderthals.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, found about 200 parking Neanderthals. A lot of their research in the caves of the mountain area. Famous Neandertal Parking in Transcarpathia, Dniester, in Zhitomir in Nadporozhzhi more.</p>
<p><b>Changes in environmental conditions</b></p>
<p>Due to icing posuvorishav climate: observed sharp contrasts in temperature (hot summers and bitter winters), and rainfall was the same as in modern semi.</p>
<p>Glacier advanced to the northern part of Ukraine, and along the Dnieper reached modern Dnipropetrovsk. Since it constantly blowing strong cold and dry winds.</p>
<p>Areas immediately adjacent to the glacier turned into a cold desert. To the south up to the Carpathians and the Black Sea stretches of tundra and cold steppes.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, heat-loving plants and animals disappeared. Instead, there were northern. The animals, for example, in Ukraine lived reindeer, arctic foxes, mammoths, hairy rhinoceros, musk ox and more.</p>
<p>Adapting to the harsh climate, the people of those times often settled in caves. This is evidenced by the numerous finds traces of Neanderthals found in caves in the Crimea.</p>
<p>In areas where there were caves, Neanderthals built homes. They have a rounded shape. Base housing was taught from mammoth bones or stones. For walls usually branches that stuck between the bones, and the top housing nakryvalysya skins of animals.</p>
<p>At that time people began to use clothing.</p>
<p>Mastered the ability to make fire.</p>
<p>Tools made using blanks in the form of flakes or plates.</p>
<p>The most common tools Neanderthals were hostrokonechnyky and scrapers. Hostrokonechnyky ruled by the edge to spears, scrapers - for knives.</p>
<p>With Neanderthals, scientists have linked the first stirrings of the spiritual life.</p>
<p>By Neanderthals belonged to the oldest person in the territory of Ukraine, whose existence is attested by the discovery of not only homes or parking lots, and remains of the man himself.</p>
<p>The cave Kyyik Koba, Crimea, was excavated Neanderthal burial: the skeletons of a woman and a small child.</p>
<p>This finding confirms a shift in human development. It makes it possible to conclude that Neanderthals cared for the dead. There is evidence and concern for patients.</p>
<p>It is believed that the Neanderthals gradually changed attitude to animals, they ceased to be a subject of hunting, but acquire meaning of the symbol, which linked the quiet life of a hunting team.</p>
<p>For example, in a small cave near Odessa discovered a huge cluster of cave bear bones - traces of a magical ritual Neanderthals. From the time of the Neanderthals survived and scoop mammoth, densely pomerezhena carved lines that seemed to outline the contours of the animal.</p>
<p>Thus, the Neanderthal era reaches the origin of art and religious beliefs. Cultivating Spirituality prorostaly among Neanderthals tens of thousands of years. However, archaeological findings also confirm the original savagery and cruelty. Thus, many findings give grounds to claim that among Neanderthals were widespread cannibalism.</p>
<p><b>3. The emergence of Homo sapiens and its lessons. The best-known Upper Paleolithic Parking</b></p>
<p>Emergence of Homo sapiens, scientists have dated 40-35 thousand. Years ago.</p>
<p>Some researchers believe that Neanderthals were not the direct ancestors of the actual person. Pointing to the significant shortcomings of their cognitive development, proponents of this view believe that the Neanderthals died out gradually. A wise man appeared quite suddenly in South Africa or Eurasia, later rozselyvshys to other areas.</p>
<p>In place of the first discoveries of ancient remains of Homo sapiens time Upper Paleolithic cave Kromanyon in France it is called Cro-Magnons.</p>
<p>Archaeological finds dated back to the late Paleolithic much more diverse and sophisticated.</p>
<p>In the Cro-Magnons were the instruments of special purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>scrubber for skin treatment, cutters for use with a bone;</li>
<li>various tip spears, knives, axes, etc;</li>
<li>In stone, has been an instrument of bone and horn - needles, awls, handle various instruments;</li>
<li>various ornaments and valuables ritual purpose, such as: bracelets, necklaces, statues, drums sticks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ukraine, studied several hundred sites that they belong to the Upper Paleolithic era. The most famous of them are located in rural Mizyn in Chernihiv and Mezhyrich of Cherkasy Dobranychivka in Kiev. Cyril and knowledge is parking in Kiev.</p>
<p><b>Mezine</b></p>
<p>On the right bank of the Desna village Mizyn Korop District found the settlement of ancient hunters of mammoths. Archaeologists have explored the remains of five dwellings game, place a stone and bone, buried pockets filled with bone charcoal, ashes, meat pit, designed for storing meat during the winter.</p>
<p>In the settlement of ancient hunters had found the remains of more than 100 mammoth bones and reindeer, rhinoceros, wild horse, musk ox, bison, bears, wolves, foxes, hares, rosomah.</p>
<p>Of great value are discovered during the excavation works of the ancient artists: female statuettes and figurines of animals from mammoth tusks, unique bracelets with mammoth bones, decorated with sophisticated carvings, ornaments of mammoth tusks and shells.</p>
<p>It was also found several large mammoth bones painted with red ocher. According to the researchers, they were used during festivals like musical instruments.</p>
<p>In the settlement, its remnants found in Mizyn, people lived 20 thousand. Years ago.</p>
<p>Lived in it, according to the researchers, up to 50 people.</p>
<p>Wise man appeared at a time when long glacial epoch. The most severe climate established in Europe 20-17 thousand. Years ago. By the time the northern territory of Ukraine held a glacial steppe, inhabited by mammoths. In the south rozlyahalysya endless cold steppes with numerous herds of bison. These climatic features determined life.</p>
<p><b>Hunters mammoths and bison</b></p>
<p>The leading occupation by Homo sapiens since the late Paleolithic remains hunting.</p>
<p>In northern Ukraine primitive hunters hunted mammoths, and in the south - the bison.</p>
<p>Hunt large animals such one person was difficult. So lived and hunted people groups from 30 - 40 people. They were cousins. So the researchers call such groups clan.</p>
<p>When eluded especially great hunt, hunters united several communities. Links to other communities also supported the purpose of the formation of new families.</p>
<p>In river valleys along which living animals, community hunters equip their settlements.</p>
<p>Hunted using spears, arranging animal traps in the form of pits.</p>
<p>Vpolovani animals are not only provided with food, but also gave the skins for clothing, footwear and covering of dwellings, bones for making tools.</p>
<p>Bright landmark buffalo hunters of life is Amvrosievsky camp in the Donbass. It is located next to a giant cluster of bones of bison. Nearly a thousand of these powerful animals hunters drove into a ravine.</p>
<p><b>Numerous archaeological materials indicate a steady population growth in Ukraine in the earliest times of human history. Our land - one of the richest in monuments of the Stone Age Europe. Because of Ukraine, which is located in the extreme southwest of Eastern Europe, was the settlement of the eastern part of the continent.</b></p>
