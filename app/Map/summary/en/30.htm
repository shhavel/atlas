<p>Cereals are the most common of all the plants grown man. Under them employ about half of the cultivated land (arable land). Appointment of diverse crops. First of all, they are used as raw food for the population and as feed for livestock.</p>
<p>This chart shows the most common grains, which are called the bread of mankind: wheat (makes about 21% of the grain), rice (20%), corn (nearly 23%).</p>
<p>Wheat crops are concentrated mainly in the temperate and subtropical zones of the Northern Hemisphere, where a sufficient amount of heat and moisture. Grow winter and spring wheat. Winter wheat has a higher yield than spring as gets a lot of moisture from melting snow in the spring and has a longer growing season. However, the cold winters without snow, it often freezes, necessitating replanting spring spring varieties. The largest producers of wheat are presented on the map. Major exporter of grain on the world market are USA, Canada, France, Australia, Argentina, South Africa. Produce high quality wheat flours, cereals, pasta and confectionery, starch, alcohol.</p>
<p>Rice is the main food crop for almost half of humanity. This culture of tropical and subtropical zones with long and warm summers. It is grown mainly in the irrigated (flooded) lands in Asia, Latin America and Africa. In most countries get two crops a year, so at a much smaller area than wheat, rice harvested almost the same amount. Asian countries produce 9/10 of world rice production. The largest producers of rice are China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Japan, Thailand.</p>
<p>Corn (maize) takes place in the traditionally high grain balance of the Western Hemisphere, which is home to her. Significant cultural dissemination has also acquired the south of Europe, China and South Africa. From corn produce flour, cereals, starch, butter, glucose, alcohol. It is widely used as a fodder crop (grain and green mass). Around half of the cultivation and export of corn falls on the United States. Quite a lot of corn is grown in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and China.</p>
<p>Livestock - this branch of agriculture that provides the population with food, supplies a variety of raw materials for light industry and the food industry, the live draft power etc. Branch is closely related to crop, so the correct combination of them - the basis of the successful development of agricultural production in general.</p>
<p>In livestock are two ways of development: intensive and extensive. With intensive development path gain of livestock products produced by increasing the productivity of animals (breeding). When stall or pasture-animal confinement and a balanced high-quality food resources (mainly concentrated feed). Such livestock in developed countries where the population is obtained with a small maximum number of products of high quality. This particularly applies to Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, USA, Australia, New Zealand. About half of the world production of meat and milk account for highly developed countries.</p>
<p>Predominantly extensive character has livestock in developing countries, where the increase in livestock production is achieved due to the growth of livestock. With such a low potential housekeeping prevails distant-pasture cattle housing systems.</p>
<p>The main components of livestock are cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, camel, horses, reindeer. The map contains information leading livestock industry, information on other branches partially represented on the map "Agriculture".</p>
<p>Breeding cattle involves raising cows, buffalo, yaks. Depending on the structure of the herd, forage, animal husbandry original product may have a dairy, meat, dairy and meat or meat and dairy. The most productive dairy cattle are bred in Europe and North America. On exports of dairy products are the leaders of Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, as well as New Zealand and Australia. Beef prevails in areas with arid climate and large areas of grassland. The world's largest beef cattle breeding area are South American steppes - Pampa. Argentina called Carvery workshop of the world, because of its leading role in the export of beef. The largest number of cattle is India, but about 60% of the cows there are not used, and the rest is used mainly as draft power. This explains the stability of religious traditions that promote the vegetarian way of eating, and the cow is considered a sacred animal.</p>
<p>Pig farming is developed mainly in densely populated areas of the world, as well as in the areas of grain and potatoes - the basics fodder industry. Half of the total number of pigs falls on Asian countries (except Muslim, where the consumption of pork is forbidden by religion). Among the countries of the world leader in the number of farmed pigs is China. A large number of pigs was also grown in the USA, Russia.</p>
<p>Sheep farming is common almost everywhere on the basis of natural pastures in the arid (dry, semi-deserts) and mountain areas. Depending on the raw material that is obtained from animals in sheep allocate such areas: fine-fleeced and polutonkorunnyh, karakulnoe, myasosalnoe, sheep-skin coat, meat and wool and milk. Exporters of wool in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, Uruguay.</p>
