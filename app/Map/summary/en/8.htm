<p>December 13, 1918 P. Skoropadskyi denied power i went to Germany. UPR was officially restored. December 14 of the Directory war came to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Dyrektoriyi dictatorship led to the power crisis. Among its members there was a difference of opinion on the direction closest Policy. The activities of this body paralizuvalasya and personal rivalries Vynnychenka i Petlyury. February 11 (the other February 10) 1919 W. Vynnycenko resigned and Petliura became the sole supreme power in the state.</p>
<p>Unlike pomirkovano conservative Hetman regime Dyrektoriya UNR government was a radical socialist orientation that determines its domestic and foreign policies.</p>
<p>Dyrektoriya failed to clean up the mess i establish effective governance. Peasant element, raging antyhetmanskym uprising was rapidly degenerate into a destructive anarchy. Directory gradually lost control over the territory where the government took over local chiefs. Ukrainian army broke up into guerrilla who fought only near their homes, and when folded adverse conditions - dissipated without a fight, pryhoplyuyuchy with a weapon. For example, if during the fall of the Hetman regime in mid December 1918 the Directorate had 100-thousand army, while in January 1919, before the surrender Kyiv - about 21000th. Ataman resorted to arbitrariness, organized pogroms. The central government has been unable to stop the anarchy. The situation was further complicated because the landing in November 1918 in southern Ukraine Allied troops, mostly French. Its intended goal - to take control of the territory, which left the German army unit - Allied units are not fully completed. However, they are of great support in Ukraine Russian White Guard counterrevolution and caused further deepen divisions within the Directorate.</p>
<p>Among the members of the Directory was no unity: some were in favor of an alliance with the Bolsheviks (V. Vynnycenko, V. Chekhivsky, Shapoval), others - for an alliance with the Entente against the Bolsheviks (Petliura).</p>
<p>Fate Dyrektoriyi decided primarily on the Soviet-Ukrainian Front (Soviet Russia's second war against UNR - the end of 1918 and beginning of 1919). From January 1919 Dyrektoriyi troops left Kharkov, which became the capital of Soviet Ukraine. Within three weeks was defeated Livoberezhne group UNR Army. Military action spread to the right bank. February 5 Bolsheviks came to Kyiv. Enthusiastically March 19, 1919 Zhmerinka Ukrainian Front was divided into two fronts: South-West, North-West, and.</p>
<p>After the army reform, getting rid napivpartyzanschyny, S. PETLIURA managed to somewhat stabilize the fronti and early June 1919 to gain a foothold on the line Starokostyantyniv - Proskuriv - Kamenetz-Podolsk. Over the rest of Ukraine (except western regions) established the Soviet control.</p>
<p>Formation of state institutions started to create a Provisional Workers 'and Peasants' Government of Ukraine, which was later renamed the Council of People's Commissars (SNK) Ukraine. Led by his authoritative Bolshevik professional revolutionary, Bulgarian nationality H. Rakowski, by Moscow. Most members of government composed of Russians and Jews, Ukrainian among senior officials were very few.</p>
<p>Soviet power in Ukraine is built according to designs that are established in Soviet Russia. January 6, 1919 the name by which the Soviets were covered in 1918 - Ukrainian People's Republic was abolished. From now until the Constitution of 1937 the official name of the state was the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR after 1937 - USSR). The highest state authority recognized the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets, in the period between congresses - All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee (VUTSVK). On the ground, the power belonged to the local councils. March 10, 1919 Third Congress of Soviets adopted the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR and thereby legalized in Ukraine Soviet regime.</p>
<p>This Constitution establishes the dictatorship of the proletariat, abolished private property and the exploiting classes deprived of voting rights. Proletarian character of the state disproportionate, reinforcing the system of elections of deputies.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Soviet regime of trying to disconnect from Ukraine Donetsk-Krivoy Rog edge and Crimea. While the former has remained a part of the republic, the Crimea was established Crimean Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>
<p>The essence of policy of the Bolsheviks was accelerated destruction of Ukraine's existing economic system based on commodity-money relations, and its replacement by direct barter, the implementation of which was entrusted to government officials. This policy was called "war communism" and was evidence of the possibility of immediate replacement of capitalism by socialism.</p>
<p>The introduction in Ukraine of "war communism" was accompanied by a marked limitation of sovereignty: the CP (B), trade unions, the Communist Youth Union of Workers Ukraine were in fact relevant branches of Russian organizations and guided Moscow - Ukraine RNA, URNH operated under the direct supervision of RNA and the Supreme Economic Council of the RSFSR - May-June 1919 established a military-political union of Soviet republics; unite under the leadership of senior civil authorities of subject: military organization and military command of the economy, railways, finance; June 4th Ukrainian Front eliminated, and the units that were part of it, formed three armiyi.Polityka Bolsheviks in Ukraine in 1919 has had a depressing effect on the population of the republic, caused discontent among the peasants, intellectuals and workers. Against the Bolshevik government began to climb the mighty peasant insurgency. The most dangerous Bolsheviks were uprising led by M. Hryhor`yeva.</p>
