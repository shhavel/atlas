<p>Oceans are the source of vital importance to human resources: biological, chemical, energy and so on. Biological resources consist of fish, shellfish (oysters, mussels, etc.), crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, shrimp, etc.), marine mammals (whales, walruses, seals) and some seaweed (kelp, helidium). The most wealthy industrialized are coastal (offshore) parts of the seas and oceans.</p>
<p>At the bottom and at the bottom of the ocean there is a lot of potential mineral resources, including oil and gas, sulfur, construction materials, iron-manganese nodules and phosphorite. The most important of them is oil. Whole world knows about 400 oil and gas fields, half of which is on the shelf and continental slope. Extraction of Marine Oil rises very quickly. It is predicted that in future sea wells will give a third of its oil.</p>
<p>Manganese nodule are close to spherical formation of oxide and hydroxide of iron and manganese with concentric internal structure. In diameter they range from 1 to 20 cm. They can also be presented as crusts on the bottom of volcanic rocks. Regardless of the type of iron-manganese deposits they are formed by chemical sediment of the elements of the ocean waters. Many concretions contain high levels of nickel, copper, cobalt, which can be used in industry.</p>
<p>Phosphorite nodules are found mostly on the continental margin. They are formed from the remains of animal organisms, preserved in the solid and unconsolidated sedimentary rocks of organic origin.</p>
<p>Sediments, the so-called red clay, are formed on the ocean floor from the sediment-rich iron oxides and clay minerals mining residues clastic material that is brought to the ocean from the continents by rivers, wind, glaciers.</p>
<p>Some mineral resources of the ocean are used, while others are waiting for the time when these are exhausted sources of raw materials on land.</p>
<p>To the mineral resources of the oceans are also resources available in seawater, salt, magnesium, bromine, gold and other elements.</p>
<p>Energy Resources of the World Ocean:</p>
<ul>
<li>energy of tides;</li>
<li>energy of ocean currents;</li>
<li>energy of the sea;</li>
<li>temperature difference energy surface and deep waters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the most energy uses the energy of tides. Construction of tidal power stations (BPS) is possible in the narrow and long bays, where the height of the tidal wave reaches ten or more meters (France, UK, Russia, Canada, USA, Norway, Argentina and others).</p>
<p>Oceanic and coastal areas in many countries are widely used as recreational resources of the oceans.</p>
