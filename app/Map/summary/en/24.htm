<p>Mineral resources</p>
<p>State balance of mineral reserves accounted for 262 deposit 32 types of minerals identified in the Crimea. The structure of the mineral potential (diagram) dominated the field of construction minerals - 154, or 58.8%. They are followed by hydrocarbons - 44 deposits (16.8%), mud - 22 deposits (8.4%), metallurgical raw materials - 16 fields (6.2%), fresh, mineral and thermal groundwater - 23 fields (8 8%), Mining chemical raw materials - 3 deposits (1.1%).</p>
<p>For the Crimean region characteristically uneven distribution of mineral deposits, because of the spatial spread of the productive geological complexes in which they were formed. The highest richness in minerals (other than fresh groundwater) is characteristic for the following districts: Leninsky and Saki (from Kerch) - 52 in each field, the Black Sea (18), Bakhchisaray, and Belogorskogo Razdolnenskiy (16 fields each) Pershamajski (15), Simferopol (14).</p>
<p>Developed more than 100 (39.5%) of mineral deposits, reflecting the high level of industrial development of the mineral resources of the ARC.</p>
