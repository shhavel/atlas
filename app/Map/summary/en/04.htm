<p>Geographic Map - a reduced generalized model of the earth's surface in the plane, which through symbols reflect location, relationship, the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of different natural and social phenomena and objects.</p>
<p>Deploying a spherical Earth's surface on a plane, you can not avoid discontinuities crossed and image distortion. To map was continuous and most accurately reflects the Earth's surface, are used map projections - mathematical methods of image on a flat plane of the spherical Earth. When creating maps in different ways carry on the plane geographic grid. Designing a grid of meridians and parallels the plane is performed using geometric shapes. By type of geometric surface map projections are divided into cylindrical, azimuthal, conical.</p>
<p>None of the projections does not allow to map wherever there were no distortions. Cartographic distortion - a violation of the geometric properties of the objects of the earth's surface (length of lines, angles, shapes and spaces) in the image of the map. The type of projection distortions are divided into equal, rivnokutovi, rivnopromizhni. Depending on the scale of the map, territory mapping choosing a particular projection.</p>
