<p><b>Basic concepts and terms</b></p>
<p>Archaeological culture - a set of similar merchandise residues obtained during archaeological excavations belong to the same historical time and territory. Similarity of form and decoration of dishes, such as jewelry, features the construction of dwellings and rice funeral rites indicate archaeological sites belonging to one nation or close to the people. Names of archaeological cultures are usually formed from the names of localities, where it was first discovered by a typical memo (Slavic culture - from the village Chernyakhiv), or the characteristics of archaeological finds (Globular Amphora culture, Shnurov culture), the characteristics of graves (carcass culture). Defining the Scope of archaeological cultures, the researchers draw conclusions about ancient population settlement, establish roots and origins of peoples and others.</p>
<p>Mesolithic - the era of the Stone Age, which was the transition between the Paleolithic and Neolithic. On the lands of Ukraine Mesolithic era lasted about 10 thousand. To 7 thousand. Years ago.</p>
<p>Neolithic - New Stone Age era, the final phase of the Stone Age, which replaced the Paleolithic and Mesolithic. It is used for the era during which the person was transferred to foraging, growing plants and animals odomashnyvshy. In Ukraine, it lasted from 7 th. To 5 thousand. Years ago (5-3 millennium BC.), According to other sources, begins in the steppe zone 6 mill., 5 th in the forest BC. ends in the plains during the first half 4. BC In the forest-steppe in early 3 mill.</p>
<p>Chalcolithic - copper-stone age - the transition from the Stone Age to the age of metals, when there are things out of copper - the first metal mastered by man, but the leading role in the manufacture of tools yet to stone. In Ukraine eneolit ​​continued in 4-3 millennium BC.</p>
<p>The Bronze Age - a period in history when, along with the stone implements were distributed, bronze (an alloy of copper and tin, at least - lead, zinc, etc.). In our area the bronze era lasted from the early 2nd to early 1st millennium BC. E. e.</p>

<p><b>1. Crisis Wildlife Society</b></p>
<p>From 16 thousand. Years ago began a gradual warming. Glaciers melted, releasing coat of ice and more land. The air became warmer and wetter water in rivers has increased, there were swamps. Dry steppes turned into a swampy tundra, occasionally covered with birch and pine groves. Some animals not fit the new climatic conditions, are extinct. Such a fate, including woolly giants - mammoths, rhinoceroses, bison, musk ox. Many holodolyubnyh animals moved away to the north. The territory of Ukraine was the land of reindeer.</p>
<p>Hunters deer staged large collective hunt, hunting down animals during seasonal transitions. Mass pokolky (by stabbing) reindeer occurred mainly when the animal crossed the river.</p>
<p>The Age hunters of reindeer in the lands of Ukraine from previous eras of ancient history was short.</p>
<p>Glacier retreated further and further north, causing profound changes in the nature of the planet.</p>
<p>About 10 thousand. Years ago in Europe established a climate similar to that of today.</p>
<p>Similar to become modern and fauna. Reindeer ever left our land. In pine and birch forests settled moose, red deer, tours, wild boar and more. It was the age of the forest hunters.</p>
<p><b>2. The life of people in the Mesolithic</b></p>
<p>The end of the Ice Age coincided with the end of the Paleolithic. The next day in the history of mankind, archaeologists called the Mesolithic.</p>
<p>Animals took the reindeer never gathered in large herds or flocks. So the hunt has become a laborious and tedious job. Hours, and sometimes days, the hunter had to hunt down prey. However vpolovanoho enough meat for long. In search of prey forest hunters moved from place to place, building temporary housing.</p>
<p>Hunters that time learned to use a bow and arrow - so were able to aim and shoot at animals from afar.</p>
<p>To outfit hunters were enlisted in winter skiing. People also used the Mesolithic era boats.</p>
<p>And yet, according to researchers, it was at that time were domesticated dog - an indispensable tool when hunting.</p>
<p>Guns for hunting were made of wood, bone, horn and flint. Tiny sharp flint plastynochky fixed in bone or wooden base. So made knives, spears, harpoons, arrows.</p>
<p>Forest hunters living in northern Ukraine.</p>
<p>In the south, people's lives a little bit different, which was due to other flora and fauna. There, in particular, were significantly vahmishymy gathering and fishing. Along the Dnieper rapids near nature was so much that people can have permanent residence. In the Crimea, as indicated by numerous archeological findings, people willingly grew roots in caves and grottos.</p>
<p><b>3. The spread of agriculture and pastoralism in the lands of Ukraine in the Neolithic</b></p>
<p>For hundreds of thousands of years, people ate what nature gave them (actually, since the earliest human occupation - hunting and gathering - scientists call pryvlasnyuvalnymy).</p>
<p>Agriculture and animal husbandry were given the opportunity, using nature to grow new plants each year and increase the number of domestic animals - that reproduce natural resources.</p>
<p>Therefore, new types of human reproductive scientists vmovylysya call.</p>
<p>Agriculture and animal husbandry have arisen during the last period of the Stone Age, which it called the Neolithic.</p>
<p>The territory of Ukraine is not a region where there were farming and animal husbandry.</p>
<p>However, local hunters for 8-6 thousand. Years. Ago took over new types of human activity on the citizens of Central Europe, which in turn borrowed them from settlers from Asia Minor. So the experience of farmers and herdsmen our ancient ancestors assimilated from various nations.</p>
<p>The emergence of agriculture has pushed people to the invention of the first artificial material - ceramics (baked clay). Because it made various dishes to store grain and cooking. Each of the nations had their favorite form of pots and preferred by, or even a pattern.</p>
<p>As the name of an ancient people did not survive, scientists posluhovuyutsya conventional, using the concept of archaeological culture.</p>
<p>Archeologists in our land in the Neolithic and Eneolithic were many branches of agriculture and animal husbandry. They belonged to different archaeological cultures whose centers were located in the South-West and Central Europe, Ukraine and the land was the eastern limit of their distribution.</p>
<p>Only one of the people that the Balkans prymandruvav probably from the Middle East, our land became the second homeland, since it is here that flourished their economy and culture. This is a Trypillja.</p>
<p>The flowering took place in Tripoli culture day eneolita.</p>
<p><b>4. Tripoli culture</b></p>
<p><b>Origin, distribution, employment</b></p>
<p>Name of Tripoli culture, and hence its carriers, conventional. It comes from the village of Tripoli in Kyiv region, which is close to the end of the 19th century. Ukrainian archaeologist Vincent Khvoiki were found the remains of life of ancient farmers.</p>
<p>Numerous archeological finds show that tripillian, descendants of one of the ancient peoples of Asia Minor, came to the land of the Lower Danube Ukraine about 7 thousand. Years ago, subsequently captured vast expanses of the Dniester to the Dnieper River and reached the territories of Volhynia and the Black Sea steppe.</p>
<p>Tripoli culture existed in our land nearly fifteen hundred years - from 4 mill. the first half of the 3 mill. It was her researchers associated consolidation of pre-Ukrainian territories reproductive economy.</p>
<p>Archaeological findings indicate a high level of reproductive management in Trypillja. The basis of it was shifting agriculture, which included the use of any land until exhausted their fertility.</p>
<p>Leaving depleted areas, farmers moved further east, thus gradually mastered all suitable for agriculture soils of the mountains to the Dnieper.</p>
<p>Tripolye sown barley, millet, wheat, grown almost all currently known in Ukraine horticultural crops. Earth treated wooden hoe with a stone or bone tip, and then - ralom. Used have probably preferred traction force.</p>
<p>Yields were harvested bone or stone sickles. Grain is milled into flour with stone zernoterok. Did tripillian and cattle. We know that their families bred cattle, goats, sheep and pigs. Stable, provided food life led to the improvement of life and creativity.</p>
<p>Tripolye extremely well mastered the technique of making pottery. Dishes are made in special pottery kilns, and complex patterns painted black, brown, red, rarely white paint. In finishing ornaments trypilian potters weave the figures of people, animals and birds.</p>
<p>With Trypillians associated with a metal in our land - that copper smelting and casting things that they previously forged with native copper.</p>
<p><b>Housing and settlement Trypillja. Social and spiritual life</b></p>
<p>High skill attained trypiltsi in the construction of housing. They lived in rectangular one- or two-storey houses with several rooms.</p>
<p>Their homes tripillian constructed as follows: in the land hammered oak pillars, and between them a bundle of sticks erected a wall covered with clay; top of the pillars was based four-level, covered with straw or reed roof with a hole for the smoke.</p>
<p>In every house built large ovens (sometimes could be an open fire), and near it - couch in baked clay. Walls and sometimes rozmalovuvalysya oven.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have found many clay models tripol dwellings. They, and the remains of homes allowed scientists to restore the appearance tripol houses.</p>
<p>Tripoli humanity lived families who are united in the community, and later tribes. First settlement Trypillians were small.</p>
<p>They lived for 50-60 people. Buildings located around, with a detachment of cattle in the center. Subsequently tripillian started building huge settlements, which lived 10 thousand. Shower. In these settlements, which are called proto concentric circles houses formed a sort of street.</p>
<p>The village Maydanetske in Cherkasy region, archaeologists have examined remains trypillya proto. It occupies an area of ​​300-400 hectares and numbered two thousand. Dwellings. Homes roztashovuvaly ten concentric circles separated by radial streets.</p>
<p>In addition to the two-story dwellings, archaeologists discovered and public buildings, fortifications, economic and ritual pits.</p>
<p>Scientists suggest that Trypillya community led by the leader. Small business he decided himself as important - the councils of all adult members of the community.</p>
<p>Archaeological finds testify later times some differences in the everyday things in different regions of settlement Trypillja. This shows the consolidation of related communities in tribes and the gradual formation of tribal groups.</p>
<p>Tripolye honored the gods of thunder, sun, rain, wind. And worshiped a goddess of fertility, because on it depended the fate of the future harvest. This is evidenced by numerous female figurines, they are found in almost every village Trypilian.</p>
<p><b>The decline of Tripoli culture</b></p>
<p>Although the high level reached by Trypillia society, it gradually accumulating signs of decline.</p>
<p>Exhausted earth gave more and smaller harvests and new areas suitable for cropping, was gone.</p>
<p>So proharchuvatysya tripillian becoming increasingly difficult. Finally, not having learned to restore soil fertility, tripillian dissolved among other nations.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 3rd millennium. Trypolian culture declined.</p>
<p>Great importance was the impact of Tripoli culture on local hunting populations. It is Trypillians from our ancestors learned how to grow corn and cattle mastered.</p>
<p>Steel helpful Trypillians pottery skill and their knowledge of metals. However, learned from experience Trypillians embodied in very different ways, mostly simple, because of the decline in Tripoli culture of features in these barely perceptible.</p>
<p><b>Tripoli culture reached a high level of development, closely approaching the origin of civilization - that is, a level of development of society, when there are cities and writing.</b></p>
<p><b>5. Pastoralists Barrens</b></p>
<p><b>Serednostohivska culture</b></p>
<p>Despite the high level of reproductive management in Trypillians, Tripoli culture was not his sole focus of the lands of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Along with Trypillians lived in the steppe zone serednostohivska humanity. With regard to other than the territories Trypillians, natural conditions Housekeeping serednostohivtsiv significantly different from trypillya.</p>
<p>Serednostohivska culture existed from the mid 4th to mid-3rd millennium BC. E. e. in areas of steppe Dnieper, Azov, the Seversky Donets Basin and the Lower Don region. The name comes from the tract average Stig (now within the city of Zaporizhzhya), where it was found monuments of culture.</p>
<p>Since desert conditions are more suitable for livestock, it was just based economy serednostohivtsiv.</p>
<p>However, the residents knew the desert and agriculture. Earth needed a sedentary life, and cattle in search of new pastures forced to move from place to place. To some extent overcome this contradiction gave to pasture cattle that he mastered serednostohivtsi.</p>
<p>Adult community members serednostohivtsiv made of the ground, and the young and older people depart for the summer season with cattle on pasture down the Dnieper. Autumn flocks of cattle, they returned to the village.</p>
<p><b>Yamna culture</b></p>
<p>Has become even more important in the life of cattle carriers Jamno culture - population that lived in the desert since the mid 3rd to early 2nd millennium BC. the territory from the Urals to the lower reaches of the Danube. In Ukraine, the remnants of the culture found in the basin of the Dnieper, Azov and the Crimea.</p>
<p>Its name is due to the peculiarities of Yamna culture burial ritual. Jamnik, Kranj herders deceased were buried in pits, over which poured mounds. Each mound ruled by tribal shrine.</p>
<p>In the tombs, archaeologists have found the remains of Jamnik, Kranj carts, indicating that their use of wheeled vehicles. In large four-wheel carts to transport Jamnik, Kranj, traveling by cattle, supply of food and tools.</p>
<p>Agile-sedentary reflected in the outlook Jamnik, Kranj. With no free time even in winter (because cattle require careful maintenance throughout the year) have left Jamnik, Kranj perfect sites: kitchenware, household utensils, ornaments in them surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>With the temples they ruled mounds, poured over the graves.</p>
<p>It was near them ushanovuvaly ancestors sacrificed to the gods, and celebrated consulted. On the mound herders sometimes installed the boulders. Their little obtesuvaly, giving the appearance of a human figure.</p>
<p>The greatest riches in Jamnik, Kranj was cattle. Researchers believe that the carriers of the culture started rearing animals for milk. Actually, it contributed more mobile lifestyle.</p>
<p>However, they have not given up entirely on field crops, growing less demanding varieties of wheat, barley, hemp and millet.</p>
<p><b>Indo-Europeans</b></p>
<p>In the boundless steppes between pastoralist cultures of that time was the formation of the people that gave birth to many modern nations, including Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Researchers call the people Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>The question of the origin of the Indo-Europeans is extremely complex and controversial. Its researchers investigate the various fields of knowledge: not only archaeologists and historians, but also linguists, for probably the history of Indo-Europeans would allow to explain the origin of many modern languages.</p>
<p>Comparing the modern languages ​​of Indo-European peoples and languages ​​of ancient monuments, researchers, linguists restore the long-dead Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Analyzing those objects and phenomena of the environment, reflected in her words, comparing them with the archaeological findings, historians have concluded that the ancestral home of the Indo-Europeans - Eastern steppes.</p>
<p>Praindoyevropeytsi were pastoralists, so soon settled in large areas. In languages ​​remote tribes developed its own features that were not in the common Indo-European language. So stood many Indo-European peoples and their languages.</p>
<p><b>Consequently, the Eneolithic in the steppe zone, as opposed to the agricultural world (present as Trypillian culture), the world was formed pastoralists. It is from the steppe pastoral environment researchers associated with a praindoyevropeytsiv - the people, from whom descended many modern Indo-European peoples, including Ukrainian.</b></p>
