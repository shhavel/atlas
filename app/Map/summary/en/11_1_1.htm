<p>With annexation of Western Ukraine to the Soviet Union began the process of Sovietization, ie changes in all spheres of life under produced during the Soviet era designs. In the process of Sovietization there are two phases:</p>
<p>- Until the spring of 1940, when the regime remained at least outwardly democratic and reform welcomed the support of most of the population;</p>
<p>- In the spring of 1940 enhances a socialist content transformation, accompanied by mass repression because of the rejection of these changes the majority of the local population.</p>
<p>Support from individuals met the following measures: elimination of the Polish state apparatus, the confiscation of land large owners, nationalization of trade and industry (the industry in the hands of the Poles and Jews), ukrainization and strengthen the education system (number of Ukrainian schools increased to 6.5 thousand. With simultaneous reduction Polish), Lviv University was renamed in honor of Ivan Franko Ukrainian was the language of instruction, etc.), the development of social welfare, particularly health care.</p>

Engineering and technical personnel, 15 thousand. Agricultural specialists, creating a network of party and Komsomol organizations, trade unions) ;</p>
<p>- Industrialization and collectivization (created new industries, garment, chemical, expanding production and processing of natural gas is the search for new mineral deposits, forming a system of production and trade and consumer cooperatives, to mid-1950 was merged into collective farms almost 93 % by mid 1951 r.- over 95% of farms);</p>
<p>- Liquidation of the Greek Catholic Church (1946) and its transition into hiding;</p>
<p>- The fight against OUN - UPA deportation of the Ukrainian population and more.</p>
