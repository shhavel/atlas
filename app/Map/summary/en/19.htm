<p>Tectonic structure of the Crimean peninsula naturally placed in the general tectonic setting of the Mediterranean geosynclinal fold belt. Their position is consistent with the geological structures.</p>
<p>In accordance with the modern geodynamic concepts of structural position and tectonic zoning Crimea major tectonic structures of the Crimean peninsula Crimean presented Mining Alpine fold-thrust structure and coating structures Epihercynian Scythian plate bordering on the north by the Black Sea Depression within the southern slope of the East European Platform. They are separated by fault zones I, be regarded also as a structural seams. The fixed structures is allocated a number of major structural elements: monoclonal, fold-and-thrust and fold systems, uplifts and shafts, depressions and troughs separating tectonic zones II order. In turn, the structural elements of the local structures are complicated by faults and lower orders.</p>
