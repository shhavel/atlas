<p><b>1. Origin of the name Rus</b></p>
<p>It was called "Rus" know first state in our country strangers. So he called her and chronicler.</p>
<p>But now as to the origin of the name "Russia" among scientists there is no unanimity.</p>
<p>Many researchers believe the word is Scandinavian in origin and brought to our land Scandinavians, Vikings. This opinion on the name "Rus" followed, and chronicler.</p>
<p>In particular, he spoke of soldiers from the north - Rousseau-Normans, who seized power in Kiev, established themselves in the city and gave its name to the local population and the territory in which the ruled.</p>
<p>In addition to the testimony of the chronicler, proponents of Scandinavian origin of the name "Russia" refer to a foreign source, none of which mentions the Slavic tribe Rousseau, although the names of, say, Derevlyany or northerners they certify.</p>
<p>For Scandinavian origin ethnonym "Rus" and serves many linguists.</p>
<p>However, this evidence refutes those researchers who believe that the name "Rus" local East Slavic origin.</p>
<p>They argue their beliefs in the Middle Dnieper large number of ancient names of rivers from the root -ros- that he deduce from -rus- like: Ros Rostavytsya, ROSAVA more.</p>
<p>Earth where these rivers flow, supporters of Slavic origin of the name "Russia", according to the territory of eastern Slavic tribe Rousseau.</p>
<p>What tribe Rousseau is not mentioned in the chronicles and other sources, they explain the ignorance of ancient authors or their inaccuracy.</p>
<p>From the chronicle name of the state centered in Kiev - Russian land - historians, scientists have created a bookish name "Kievan Rus", which is now in general use.</p>
<p><b>2. The first winner of Russian land</b></p>
<p>Consolidation of the state with the center in Kyiv the name "Russian Land" took place in the second half of the 9th century. and was associated with acts of Russian rulers Askold and Dir.</p>
<p>And still tense debate about who were these called Kievan chronicler rulers.</p>
<p>Some, mooring to the opinion of the author of "The Tale of Bygone Years", according to their Norman rulers.</p>
<p>Others see the Dirovi and Askold Polyansky princes - sons Kyi.</p>
<p>About reign Hole today nothing definite can be said. Much more fortunate Askold, which the researchers attributed certified foreign source voyage to Byzantium 860.</p>
<p><b>Hike Askold Byzantium</b></p>
<p>Having collected a considerable army, Askold 860. Plundered and devastated suburbs Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and he kept a week siege.</p>
<p>Powerful blow Russian Navy forced the Byzantine Empire to recognize Russia as a state. As the chronicler, since it was called Ruthenian lands.</p>
<p>Probably that, during the peace negotiations with the Emperor Askold most of his warriors were baptized.</p>
<p>However, the further spread of Christianity in Rus state narazylasya difficulties.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that not all of the prince surrounded realized vision of foreign policy measures Askold not all empowered Rus agreed with them. Against Duke began to mature plot.</p>
<p><b>Establishment of the Rurik dynasty</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the north Eastern Slavic tribes extended his rule militant warrior-prince Rurik. This is in support of Rurik, as suggested by the researchers hoped conspirators. However, 879 g. He died.</p>
<p>So to complete the intentions, the rebels have obtained support Ryurykovoho relative Oleg. He was the guardian of the infant son of Prince Rurik - Igor and, therefore, had the authority to rule on behalf of the prince.</p>
<p><b>So, killing 882. Prince Askold, began to reign in Kiev, Oleg kind of Rurik. This fact researchers interpret as a statement in the Rus Rurik dynasty. Those who believe Askold descendant Polyansky Prince Kyi claim that as a result of the conspiracy advocates Oleg ended the dynasty Kyyevychiv.</b></p>
<p><b>3. The Management Board Oleg</b></p>
<p><b>Expanding the boundaries of the Kievan state</b></p>
<p>According to the chronicler, Oleg Prince of Kiev 30 years, discovering talent wise ruler and a talented commander.</p>
<p>Chronicler said that at the beginning of his reign, had to fight against Oleg Derevlyany and northerners. Conquered their new Kyiv prince began to push the boundaries of their possessions.</p>
<p>Year 885 he annexed the land Radimichi went on a campaign against the convict and Tivertsy.</p>
<p>In the early 10th century. Oleg agreed to participate in its military campaigns princes Croats Tivertsy and Volyn.</p>
<p>The structure of the Kievan state also includes tribal Slovenes and Krivichy. In addition, Oleg conquered the northern and non-Slavic peoples, including Meyrueis, all, Chud.</p>
<p>From the Norman rulers prince concluded a peace agreement, by which for a long time the Kievan princes attracted Norman's wife in joint military campaigns.</p>
<p>Oleg wisely avoided confrontation with the tribes scars that about 898 g. Came to Kyiv. Prince has allowed them defenseless to pass by their land, and they pokochuvaly further away beyond the Carpathians, leaving a piece of yourself near Kyiv (now within the city limits) name - Hungarian tract.</p>
<p><b>Campaigns against Byzantium</b></p>
<p>According to the chronicles, year 907, Oleg led an expedition against Byzantium. The story chronicler of the brilliant victory of the legendary Oleg full details and details.</p>
<p>But the greatest value to historians is listed in the "Tale of Bygone Years" into the contract between Rusichi and Byzantines.</p>
<p>Terms of the agreement were favorable for Russia.</p>
<p>Byzantium at the mercy of every pay Rus warrior UAH 12 and a considerable tribute to the Russian princes and influential Duke East Slavic tribes who obeyed Oleg.</p>
<p>For Ruthenian state recognized the right to trade with Byzantium without paying customs duties.</p>
<p>The Byzantines were obliged to hold n merchants in its capital - Constantinople for six months and still provide all the necessary equipment for the return journey.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions 907. Were specified in 911. - Oleg after the new campaign.</p>
<p><b>Making Oleg partnership agreement with Byzantium was an exceptional value, as demonstrated international recognition of the Russian state. The agreement drew a line under that period of the history of the Kievan state, which it is called formation. This is why scientists have used the name "Kievan Rus" is from the early 10 century.</b></p>
<p><b>4. The Board of Prince Igor</b></p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor trustee and the Principality of Oleg, the chronicle stories of which still prevails legendary Prince Igor - very real historical figure.</p>
<p>Having gained power after the death of Oleg in 912 g. Son of Prince Rurik ruled in Kiev to 945.</p>
<p>As Oleg, he had to deal with disobedience princes subject to tribes.</p>
<p>Nayzatyatishymy in the fight against the power of Rurik were drevlyans. Clashes with them Igor began his reign, in opposition to them met his death.</p>
<p>Year 914, Igor lucky Derevlyany rein and impose on them a tribute greater than Oleg.</p>
<p>Do not want to recognize the power and Igor's Ukichi you paid a high price - three years of armed struggle against the prince's army, they left their homes and went to the Southern Buh and Dniester.</p>
<p>Silas had to use weapons against the Tivertsy.</p>
<p>Military measures Igor does not indicate its exceptional militancy or violence. These were the laws of that time of life, according to which the right to rule had to prove strength. The expression of the relationship between ruler and subordinates were polyude and collecting tribute.</p>
<p>After collecting tribute prince tried to sell it profitably. Money and merchandise overseas, he calculated with hired soldiers paid for their participation in military campaigns and his retainers.</p>
<p><b>Trekking games against Byzantium</b></p>
<p>Chronicle tells the story of two such trips. First, the year 941, was unsuccessful. Boats Rus was burned by the Byzantines.</p>
<p>The failure prompted the games to a new campaign. Treat it 944. And ended with the signing of the peace agreement. On a contract detail tells chronicler. Witness of him, and Byzantine sources.</p>
<p>Of those stories know that conditions Ruthenian Byzantine agreement 944. Were written on parchment in duplicate. One of them, on which stood a cross, and the names of the Russian princes, remained in Constantinople.</p>
<p>Another copy, signed by the Byzantine ambassadors remained in Kiev.</p>
<p>Among the terms of the agreement, which was generally less profitable for Russia than deal Oleg attracts prince of Kiev obligation to provide military assistance to Byzantium.</p>
<p>In its foreign policy the Games had to consider not only the Byzantine Empire, but also on the Pechenegs - nomadic people, who first approached the borders of of 915 g.</p>
