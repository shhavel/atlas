<p>Mineral resources - a combination of mineral reserves of mineral origin that are used or could be used in future human activities. Nowadays, most used more than 200 kinds of minerals. Depending on the purpose of mineral resources are divided into three groups.</p>
<p>Fuel (energy) - are used to produce heat and light.</p>
<p>Metal (Ore) - which smelt metals (ferrous and non-ferrous metals).</p>
<p>Nonmetallic (non-metallic) - used as raw material for the chemical industry (potassium salt, phosphates, sulfur, etc.) as construction and industrial raw materials (asbestos, graphite, diamonds, etc.).</p>
<p>Mineral deposits on Earth are very uneven, due to the peculiarities of the tectonic structure of the crust. For a better understanding and explanation of the patterns of distribution of minerals on the tectonic map shows the area of ​​the continents (platform and orogen).</p>
<p>Fuel and some non-metallic minerals that are of sedimentary origin, formed due to the accumulation of age sedimentary rocks. The deposits of these minerals are often found in ancient sedimentary rock platforms and troughs in the foothill areas of ancient and ancient folding. In the relief of this tectonic structures correspond plains (see. Physical map of the world).</p>
<p>Mining and chemical non-metallic minerals also are mainly of sedimentary origin.</p>
<p>Metallic minerals are confined to ancient Precambrian shields and platforms orogen crust. That is why most abundant ore minerals have old low mountains, highlands and plateaus.</p>
<p>Iron ore (iron, manganese) in the crust overlying layers, forming a large area pools.</p>
<p>Ferrous metals occur in the bowels of the earth kind of belts. Yes, copper and polymetallic ores are common in folded regions of the Cordilleras - the Andes, tin ore - in the Pacific zone.</p>
<p>The availability of mineral resources is a good prerequisite for economic development of any country.</p>
