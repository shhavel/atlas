<p>Map - this is one of the models of reality, so depending on what you want to model in a particular case, creating different types of cards.</p>
<p>In terms of area produce maps of the world (representing the entire Earth's surface), hemispheres, continents and their parts, and so cards States.</p>
<p>In scale is small-scale maps (1: 1 000 000), medium-(1: 1 000 000 to 1: 200 000), a large-scale (1: 200 000).</p>
<p>In content maps can be general geographic and thematic. Thematic maps are divided into two groups: geographical economic and geographic. In general geographic maps the main element is the surface of objects placed on it. Topographic maps - a group of large-scale general geographic maps, which include the actual topographic maps (scale 1: 200 000 and larger) and topographic survey (scale 1: 200 000 to 1: 1 000 000). Topographic maps are a source of a variety of information about the places used for precise measurements and calculations, creating special maps (geological, soil, etc.) As well as for direct local orientation. In leaf fragment of topographic map scale 1:25 000 shown and described basic geodetic points, towns, buildings, individual buildings and local objects, railways and roads, transmission line wire, administrative boundaries, terrain, hydrographic network, vegetation, soils. List of main objects depicted on topographic maps are presented in conventional signs for topographical maps of scale 1:25 000.</p>
