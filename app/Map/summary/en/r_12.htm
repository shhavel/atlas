<p>The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest after the Pacific Ocean. In the meridional direction it extends across all geographical zones at 16 000 km and this explains the diversity of climatic conditions. Ocean water is very warm, even in the extreme south and north the temperature drops below 0 Â° C, and therefore to the local common areas are floating icebergs.</p>
<p>The width of the Atlantic Ocean near the equator is the smallest, so here is the influence of most of the continents to the ocean.</p>
<p>Bottom topography is represented by North and Pivdennoatlantychnym ranges and lower ridges and individual basins. The maximum depth of the ocean reaches 8742 meters (Puerto Rico Trench).</p>
<p>The coastline of Atlantic ocean highly dissected in the northern hemisphere, there are large bays, most of the sea and islands. In tropical latitudes of some of the islands formed due to intensive capacity-shelf corals.</p>
<p>Because of the large size and large length of ocean climate is extremely diverse. The water temperature decreases toward the equator to the south and the north. Water salinity ranges from 8 & permil; in the Baltic Sea 37 & permil; in tropical latitudes. Due to the large circulation of air and water masses observed violation of zonal distribution of temperature and salinity distribution.</p>
<p>The organic world of the Atlantic Ocean is rich in fish (mackerel, tuna, cod, herring), mammals (whales, seals, sea elephants) and many other representatives of wildlife. In the waters of the ocean is intense fishing and seafood.</p>
<p>Because the ocean washed the shores of many countries (including the US, Canada, Western Europe), here lie the main shipping routes. Ocean waters carried the lion's share of the world passenger and freight traffic. Atlantic Ocean is connected to the Indian Suez Canal and the Pacific - the Panama Canal. Opening of these channels, respectively, in 1869 and 1914 significantly reduced the sea routes between countries and continents, and revived navigation.</p>
<p>Intensive Utilization of the ocean has taken its toll. Large water area in the central part of the heavily polluted due to accidents of oil tankers, sinking boats and nuclear waste disposal different. All it does great harm to the ocean and encourages international environmental organizations to conduct consistent struggle for the reduction of anthropogenic impact on the ocean and preserving its biodiversity.</p>
