<p>Natural growth depends on many factors. Until the XVIII century. growth of the world population depended mainly on biological processes. At this level of fertility and mortality were very high and as a result - low natural increase (see. Graph is presented with a map Area population). Nowadays everything tangible impact on the reproduction of the population acquire socio-economic factors: the level of welfare and living conditions, the level of medicine and public health and nutrition, the degree of involvement of women to participate in social processes, the ratio between urban and rural populations national and religious traditions of others. Among the global historical reasons that hinder the natural growth of the population - political upheaval and social crisis, the deterioration of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Rate of natural increase can be positive, negative or zero value, characterizing, respectively, increase or decrease in population invariance area due to different correlation between fertility and mortality. In most countries there is a positive natural growth. Rapid growth rates of natural increase are called population explosion and turned into one of the global challenges whose solution can be subject to governments adequate population policies.</p>
<p>Prevalence of mortality over the birth rate - negative natural increase is called depopulation. The phenomenon of depopulation typical for transition countries (Ukraine, Latvia, Hungary, Bulgaria) and some developed countries in Europe (Germany, Sweden).</p>
<p>Gender composition of the population - is the ratio of men and women, depending on the biological, historical and social reasons. In general, the world of men slightly more than women. Among the countries where the male half of the population - China, India, Turkey. The predominance of women in these countries is due to historically disadvantaged women (early marriage, multiple and early childbearing, especially the mentality, etc.).</p>
<p>In most countries the situation is reversed. Particularly notable predominance of women in countries that actively participated in the Second World War and other military conflicts. Genetically determined that the average life expectancy of 5-8 years longer than men.</p>
<p>Addition to the maps are relevant diagrams (pyramids), filed with the map distribution of population. Gender and age pyramid shows the ratio of male and female population by age category as a percentage. The pyramid is made for a particular country at a particular year. There are two types of age structure, corresponding to the types of population reproduction. The first (regressive) type in the age structure is formed narrower (I) type of population reproduction. For it is a small percentage of young people (under 15 years) and a significant proportion of older people (over 55-65 years). This distribution of population by age is characteristic mainly developed countries (Japan, USA). The second (progressive) type of age structure are emerging with expanded (ii) the type of population reproduction. There is a very large proportion of children and adolescents with a low proportion of the elderly population (India).</p>
