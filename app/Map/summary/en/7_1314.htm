<p><b>Basic concepts and terms</b></p>
<p>Monarchy (from Gr. Autocracy) - the state in which the highest power is concentrated in the hands of the sole holder and transferred hereditary members of the ruling dynasty.</p>
<p><b>Personality</b></p>
<p>Monomakh (Vladimir Vsevolod, Basil, 1053-1125 gg.) - An outstanding statesman of Kievan Rus Grand Prince of Kyiv (1113-1125 gg.), Commander and writer. Son Yaroslav and Vsevolod daughter of Emperor Constantine Monomakh vizantantiyskoho. This Russian princes was undoubtedly one of the most gifted. Interestingly, he explained monomials their success not by some exceptional abilities and great diligence and zeal, and these traits he wanted to bring up the children. Starting an active prince activity 13 years lad, Monomakh soon became "the sword in the hands of his father" - sage and scribe who "sydya learned five languages ​​at home" and apparently had no doable to military campaigns. And part of Monomakh eighty three battles (this is the number refers to the prince in his "Instructions for Children") is not muted in him the love of words to bookish wisdom. So Vladimir Monomakh be called harmonious personality, which combined physical perfection of spiritual perfection.</p>
<p><b>1. Will the sons of Yaroslav the Wise</b></p>
<p>Do you remember what was the thorny path of Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev to the table.</p>
<p>To protect their own children from the princely strife, he took care of the new principle stolonasliduvannya that was based on seniority.</p>
<p>Chronicler's story during 1054 we learn that Yaroslav gave his eldest son Izjaslaw Kyiv, Chernihiv - Sviatoslav Pereyaslav - Vsevolod, Vladimir-Volyn - Games and Smolensk - Vyacheslav, bequeathing them "not to cross fraternal fiefdoms."</p>
<p>The idea of ​​Yaroslav was the fact that each of the children was in Kiev pocherezhno table: Table in newly freed kotriys of land, how was Brothers Moving a step higher and closer to Kyiv. Main, on the order of Yaroslav, was to be the eldest of the brothers.</p>
<p>In historical science, there is no consensus in the evaluation of the covenant of Yaroslav.</p>
<p>Some researchers believe it prudent and far-sighted decision that if compliance would ensure the territorial integrity of the state.</p>
<p>Others see the will of the prince of the event that led to the fragmentation of a single state into separate independent principality. It is the text that he cites chronicler does not mention Yaroslav nephews - the sons and grandsons of his brother, who, of course, also claimed Velikoknyazheskaya heritage and, feeling insulted, have initiated new wars.</p>
<p>There is also a view that the covenant as such does not exist, and the text inserted in the chronicle was compiled by order of Yaroslav beloved son Vsevolod, who fell to reign in Kiev last of Yaroslavichy.</p>
<p><b>2. Board Yaroslavichy</b></p>
<p>After the death of Yaroslav the Wise in the history of the Russian state it is time to many heroes, as the sole ruler of a mighty power was not sufficiently long.</p>
<p>Highlights of the earth, as already noted, was concentrated in the hands of the elders Yaroslavichy - Iziaslav, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod.</p>
<p>Junior - Igor and Vyacheslav - received minor possession and, moreover, soon died.</p>
<p>No better fate had one more overbearing Yaroslaviv relative - Vseslav Polotsk, the grandson of Yaroslav's older brother, Prince of Polotsk.</p>
<p><b>The power of three</b></p>
<p>With the most important areas, older Yaroslaviches first ruled the state rather smoothly.</p>
<p>Formally, Prince of Kiev was Iziaslav - and that this role he assigns chronicler, constantly stressing, however, that he was willing to consult with his younger brother.</p>
<p><b>Fight against nomads</b></p>
<p>The biggest hassle Yaroslavichy brothers were nomads. First, they had to fight against Torquay.</p>
<p>However, these Turkic tribes had already considerable force, for themselves suffered from warlike Kipchaks, who came in the first half of the 11th century. in the Black Sea steppes of the Caspian.</p>
<p>By Rus borders Kuman first came in 1055 At that time there were no clashes: Pereyaslav Prince Vsevolod was able to break out polovtsy peacefully.</p>
<p>But when in 1062 Polovtsian horde again came to Pereyaslav, it appears that the wife alone to repel attackers Vsevolod enough. And even then Kuman if tested strength.</p>
<p>The real battle took place in 1068, the River Alt.</p>
<p>United host three Yaroslavichy reduced to nothing.</p>
<p>Prince fled.</p>
<p>Vsevolod was afraid to stay in Pereyaslav and went to Iziaslav in Kyiv.</p>
<p>Helplessness princes angered people of Kiev. Spontaneous protests and discontent escalated into an uprising.</p>
<p><b>Rise of Kyiv residents in 1068</b></p>
<p>In the face of attacks on the city of Kiev Polovtsian gathered at the Chamber and agreed to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>With the requirement to give them horses and weapons, as proclaimed chronicler, they moved to the princely palace.</p>
<p>Iziaslav refused to do the will of the insurgents - and was forced to flee. Instead, the people of Kiev "remembered" about a prisoner in Polotsk prince Vseslava slash (his imprisonment Yaroslaviches probably hoped to rid unwanted contender for the Grand inheritance), released him and announced Kyiv owner.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod not opposed Vseslava illegal activities, and vice versa - sat quietly in their possession until the offended Iziaslav wandering in strange lands.</p>
<p><b>Return to Iziaslav Kyiv</b></p>
<p>Senior Jaroslawich found refuge not brothers, but a distant relative - Polish King Boleslaw II.</p>
<p>Recovering from Kiev events, he in 1069 he led an army of Boleslaw to.</p>
<p>Kyiv residents, frightened by the approach of Polish soldiers, appealed to Svyatoslav and Vsevolod.</p>
<p>Younger Yaroslaviches demanded that Iziaslav so that he did not lead to Kyiv of strangers and do not harm the people of Kiev. And bloodshed still did not escape.</p>
<p>Chronicler said that before him Iziaslav sent his son and he avenged his father brutally disposing of the most active participants in last year's uprising.</p>
<p><b>Restore power of three</b></p>
<p>Iziaslav returned to Kyiv. It would have had to resume its former board of three coherent Yaroslavichy.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, brotherly affection if indeed prevailed over ambition.</p>
<p>Iziaslav enriched unfortunate experience in 1068, ordered the transfer auction, which held rallies on the Mount - under the supervision of the prince and his wife.</p>
<p>Do not avoid retribution and Vseslav, the same year Iziaslav drive them out of Polotsk, the city gave to his son.</p>
<p>Among the state's most significant event was the meeting of the princes Vyshgorodskaya 1072</p>
<p>Dedicated to the transfer of the relics of Saints Boris and Gleb to the newly built church, she has collected, in addition to the princes, as metropolitan bishops, abbots of the largest monasteries.</p>
<p>Vshanuvavshy saints, princes consulted and for worldly affairs. Then it was approved, including a set of Russian laws "Truth Yaroslavichy", together with articles made of Yaroslav the Wise "n the truth."</p>
<p><b>3. Fight for Kyiv table between Yaroslaviches</b></p>
<p>But even as the ceremony was furnished Vyshgorodskaya meeting, she ended the controversy between Yaroslaviches.</p>
<p>Year 1073 between the sons of Yaroslav the Wise split. With the support of Vsevolod, Svyatoslav went to Kyiv, drove Iziaslav and became Grand Prince of Kiev.</p>
<p>During the three-year reign, he redistributed the land for the benefit of his family, conquered numerous relatives, showing the ability of strong ruler.</p>
<p>Illustrative in this respect is the relationship with Kiev Svyatoslav clergy. The group most dissatisfied reign of Sviatoslav belonged to the abbot Theodosius Pechersky monastery.</p>
<p>According to the Chronicle, he openly condemned the Chernigov prince of violence committed on Iziaslav. But within a year Sviatoslav able to change attitude towards him so that Theodosius gave his monastery under his care.</p>
<p>After all, Sviatoslav allocated funds for the construction of the monastery glorious Assumption Cathedral.</p>
<p>And implementation plans Sviatoslav prevented death: he died in late 1076</p>
<p>The tragic event opened the way to Kyiv younger Yaroslavichy. However, it gave hope to the outcasts Iziaslav that this time of trouble in peresydzhuvav Boleslaw II, to return home.</p>
<p>And while Iziaslav lashtuvavsya to march to Kyiv, Kyiv became Prince Vsevolod.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the great powers, he redistributed tables, translating Svyatoslav son Oleg Volyn and Chernigov gave her - Vladimir Monomakh.</p>
<p>In Russia moved Iziaslav with the Polish army. Vsevolod met with his brother and peacefully settled conflicts.</p>
<p>Since 1078, the eldest of Kiev Kyiv won the third table. Svyatoslav was deprived of the most important possessions.</p>
<p>Without any hope to regain their lost, they took up arms. In the civil wars were involved many disgruntled relatives, and even external enemies of - Polovtsian.</p>
<p>In the fratricidal war in August 1078 put the head of Iziaslav. Kiev became the sole owner of Vsevolod.</p>
<p>The main focus of his work was to overcome internal strife mizhknyazivski.</p>
<p>In foreign policy, a matter of life and death remained Polovtsian threat.</p>
<p>Despite the unfavorable conditions, the reign of Vsevolod Kiev was successful. And the success of an elderly lord had already owe his son Vladimir.</p>
<p>So the measures that need to use military force, led by the orders of his father, Vladimir Monomakh, Vsevolod and he took care of the spiritual life.</p>
<p>During his rule was completed</p>
<ul>
<li>construction and painting of the Assumption Cathedral of Kiev Pechersk Monastery</li>
<li>founded St. Andrew's (Yanchina) Monastery of the first women's school</li>
<li>built St. Peter's and St. Michael in VYDUBYCHI more.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The temptation of power</b></p>
<p>After the death of Vsevolod 1093 nothing seemingly prevented Vladimir Monomakh possess Kyiv table.</p>
<p>At that time he owned Chernihiv, had the backing of Pereyaslav, where reigned his younger brother Rostislav was honored citizens.</p>
<p>However monomials not consented to the tempting offer and invited to Kyiv table elder son Yaroslav - Svjatopolka Iziaslavych, because he had seniority on the basis of pre-emptive rights to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Soon Monomakh had to renounce and Chernigov. After the death of Vsevolod offended Oleg Svyatoslavich declared their rights by threatening a new civil wars.</p>
<p>To avoid bloodshed, renounced Monomakh of Chernigov and took possession of Pereyaslav, the table which was empty because of the tragic death of Rostislav.</p>
<p>Twenty years of reign in the southern Ruthenian lands passed to Monomakh in continuous concerns, chief among which were the Cumans.</p>
<p><b>4. Lyubetsky congress of princes</b></p>
<p>Fight against Polovtsian attackers needed to attract wives of other princes. Similarly, the Accord could put an end to the princely strife.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the Vladimir Monomakh maintained close relations with brothers and nephews. He, in particular, the initiative belonged to the princes of Congress Liubech 1097</p>
<p>In Lyubetskoy congress approved the principle of paternal prince - that possession that belonged to my parents.</p>
<p>Otchynnym land was assigned to a specific branch of the princely family and could be inherited to children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Yes, Kyiv was recognized paternal descendants Iziaslav represented Svjatopolka Iziaslavych prince of Kiev, Chernigov belonged Svyatoslavichy and Pereyaslav - Vladimir II (Monomakh).</p>
<p><b>5. Exacerbation mizhknyazivski controversy after Lyubech Congress</b></p>
<p>Although unanimity which were, according to the chronicler marked Lyubech Congress decisions, they do not put an end to the quarrels of princes.</p>
<p>The right was reserved only for children and grandchildren three Yaroslavichy - Iziaslav, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod.</p>
<p>Another princely brothers had to be content with meager possessions, besides those that were in zahalnorodoviy property managers of any recognized paternal owners.</p>
<p>By the band "disadvantaged" princes, in addition to numerous Yaroslav nephews, got his direct grandson of David I..</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the latter took an active part in the brutal wars that broke out immediately after the Congress in Liubech.</p>
<p>Her victim was a particular Terebovlyansky Cornflower prince, the son of the eldest sons of Yaroslav Vladimirovich Rostislav, who was blinded by the will of David Igorovych and most resented, Svjatopolka Iziaslavych.</p>
<p><b>So, life was more complicated than bombastic speech at Lyubech Congress. Still, a positive result was that the collection: after meeting Liubech prince met regularly. It is their princes discussed the most contradictory issues, including the issue of allotments.</b></p>
<p><b>6. Establishment of Vladimir Monomakh on Kyiv table</b></p>
<p>The first decade of the 12th century. fugitive confronted with polovtsians.</p>
<p>The Rus princes won more confident. In addition, more and more fighting took place in the desert, annual trips to the Polovtsian land of Rus' princes ubezpechuvaly own possession from sudden and violent attacks.</p>
<p>The most active participant in the struggle against Polovtsian remained Pereyaslav Prince Vladimir Monomakh. His brilliant victories he earned fame protector n land.</p>
<p>So when in 1113 in Kiev prince died Sviatopolk, Kiev, disappointed its not a very good rule, revolted, demanding a prince Vladimir Monomakh.</p>
<p><b>Researchers tend to see in Kiev uprising in 1113 thin calculation princes - candidates for Kyiv table, especially Monomakh. After all, according to the law of estates Vladimir II could occupy Kiev table. Certain legality of the establishment in Kiev, in fact, had the rebellion will Kyivites.</b></p>
<p>According to the Chronicle, Monomakh Kyiv at first refused, but when the rebels began to threaten large-scale arbitrary wise prince agreed. Kyiv met Vladimir Monomakh as a prince April 20, 1113 "with great honor."</p>
<p><b>7. State measures Vladimir Monomakh</b></p>
<p>The main purpose of his reign of Vladimir Monomakh Grand Duke saw in consolidating government and enhancing the national unity of.</p>
<p>In his immediate possessions were vast areas. Also Pereyaslav, Novgorod and Kyiv, Monomakh captured Turov-Pinsk ground, later dawdle.</p>
<p>Authority prince was undeniable, so no one dared to oppose his will. In addition, to establish peaceful relations between Rus Prince Volodymyr Monomakh used marriages.</p>
<p>Among the events of Prince aimed at improving the political situation, it is extremely important place had its legislation.</p>
<p>At a meeting in the village Berestova, participation in which was, in addition to his wife Monomakh, high military officials from Kyiv, Belgorod, Pereyaslav and representatives of the Chernigov prince, was approved by the "Charter", which was a supplement to the "Russian Truth".</p>
<p>Recent posts limited action moneylenders and landlords,</p>
<p>significantly improving the situation of the middle class and peasants.</p>
<p>"Charter" also encouraged merchants. Provision, for example, benefits to those of them who had lost property during the war or fire.</p>
<p>External links Monomakh of the Rus times were strikingly different. As Yaroslav the Wise, Vladimir concluded dynastic marriages with European rulers. Inter-dynasty combined Kyiv ties with Byzantium, Britain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the German Empire, Hungary.</p>
<p>As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir Monomakh made several successful campaigns against the Polovtsian. However, during the Monomakh they are not too militant, disputes are often resolved by peaceful means - those same dynastic marriages.</p>
<p>Monomakh died in 1125</p>
<p>Buried Prince (as well as his father) in St. Sophia Cathedral, which was an expression of his enormous prestige - so great that without any objection provided the consolidation of Kiev Mstislav table - the eldest of Monomakh.</p>
<p><b>8. The Board of Mstislav Vladimirovich</b></p>
<p>Mstislav was a worthy father. Over the seven-year rule in Kiev (1125-1132 gg.) Subsequently poshanovuvaly name is great.</p>
<p>Mstislav skillfully managed the state, strengthened Grand authorities, keeping in check the Restive relatives.</p>
<p>Several successful campaigns against the Polovtsian who tried to "take down" after the death of Monomakh, provide peace of mind at the southern border of the state.</p>
<p>By Mstislav brisk west direction of foreign policy.</p>
<p>In Kiev, was laid stone church of St. Theodore and Virgin Pirogoshchaya, consecrated the church of St. Andrew Yanchina monastery.</p>
<p>Mstislav remembered by descendants of the great more and that he was the last prince of Kiev, whose power can be characterized as a monarchist. After his death in Kievan Rus began adding fragmentation - strengthening the independence of autonomous principalities and power of feudal princes.</p>
