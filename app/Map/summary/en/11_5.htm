<p>Deploying the resistance movement in Ukraine</p>
<p>In the early months of the war, when the victorious offensive of the German troops, the resistance movement was also arranged in order. Soviet command of trying to create a network of groups and guerrilla forces behind enemy lines. But these groups were extremely unprofessional and so quickly found the enemy and zneshkodzhuvalysya.</p>
<p>Ukrainian national forces early in the war were grouped into three independent groups: "Woodland Sich" led by Taras Bulba-Borovets and two branches of Ukrainian nationalists, one led by Stepan Bandera, a friend - Andrew Miller.</p>
<p>Germans coming Ukrainian nationalists tried to use for restoration of Ukrainian statehood. The firmest action undertook OUN Bandera. It was set up three groups of derivatives to be moving from the western border, respectively, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa. Their task was to implement liberated from the Bolsheviks in Ukraine Ukrainian civil administration and local government. June 30, 1941 a group of OUN (B), headed by Jaroslaw Stetsko joined the Lions kept the Soviet troops and proclaimed the Act of Ukrainian state. But the same day the Germans entered the city. Mastered the situation, the occupiers said that their plan is no place for Ukrainian statehood. OUN leaders arrested and sent to concentration camps.</p>
<p>OUN Miller acted more moderately and cautiously. Its representatives were able to create in occupied Kiev, Ukrainian National Rada interfere with the city administration and public life. In late 1941 Reichscommissariat Ukraine banned the Council, but it existed underground for over a year. Main leaders of the Ukrainian movement was arrested in Kiev, and soon - executed.</p>
<p>Back in July 1941 in Lviv efforts of the OUN and the Ukrainian National Council. The organization is conceived as an auxiliary cord "Ukrainian people in Galicia, Volhynia those Holm" and his broker before the German authorities. Council tried to cover its activities in all public areas of Western Ukraine, representatives of various sections of the population and land areas. Pattern and honorary president of the Ukrainian National Council chose the Greek Catholic Metropolitan Andrey Sheptitskiy. But this form of Ukrainian government is not happy with the occupiers, and in March 1942 the Council banned.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1942 remained the only Ukrainian legal socio-political institution - Ukrainian Central Committee is headquartered in Krakow. Committee was headed by Vladimir Kubiyovych. Powers of the Committee restricted to purely humanitarian issues, and activities are strictly controlled by the occupation authorities.</p>
<p>Commander "Polesie Host" Bulba-Borovets, focusing on the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile. Organization was developing in Polesie and Volhynia was isolated against the Soviet military units hiding in the woods. The goal of their struggle Bulba-Borovets saw the revival of the UPR. But when in November 1941 the occupation authorities proposed Sich voluntarily lay down their arms, those temporarily curtailed activity.</p>
<p>Along with Ukrainian and Soviet partisans in Ukraine, mainly in Polesie, were Polish resistance group (Union of armed struggle, and then - Army). Their activities skerovuvalas immigrant Polish government in London. The group consisted of the military personnel Polish. The point of the struggle of the Poles was directed against the German occupiers and their aim was revived Poland in pre-war borders. For a time the relationship between Polish and Ukrainian forces Resistance characterized as tense neutrality.</p>
<p>In 1942 resistance movement throughout Ukraine strong organizational and embraced by many people. Instead crushed in the first year of the war underground organization emerged a new, more sustainable, better trained and armed. The reason for this was a deep disappointment in the German government, which at first many in Ukraine look like on vyzvolytelku. The second reason was the failure of the German army near Moscow and the beginning of the Soviet troops.</p>
<p>With awareness of the importance of the deployment of the partisan movement in the rear of the enemy, the Soviet leadership has come from the organization and arrangement of guerrilla groups. May 30, 1942 the State Defense Committee USSR created at the rate of the High Command headquarters of the guerrilla movement. He was subject to Ukrainian Partisan Movement Headquarters (USHPR), led by Timothy Strokacha. Since a single coordinated command of guerrilla groups and coordinated their activities with the regular army.</p>
<p>The most favorable conditions for guerrilla warfare prevailing in Polesie and in the Carpathians. Mountain forests and protected the guerrillas and allowed small forces to inflict significant damage to the enemy. The main focus of Soviet partisans in 1942 was a forest on the border of Ukraine and Bryanschiny. From there, Kim Kovpaka partisan connections and Alexander Saburova fall of 1942 went to the right bank, causing intense strikes the rear of the enemy. In the spring of 1943 went the same route groups Alexei Fedorov. Simultaneously raid deep central regions of Ukraine made a team of Mikhail Naumov. The result of these raids was that the occupation authorities lost control of large areas in Polesie, which became a solid partisan edge. One of the main objectives of the partisans was a violation of enemy communications. Since August 1943 the guerrillas were so-called "rail war", preventing the transportation of equipment and ammunition to the front. This, to some extent, helped the Red Army defeat at Kursk and Kyiv.</p>
<p>Natural conditions in southern Ukraine, with a predominance of open space has not helped in the successful guerrilla actions. Therefore, in these areas of resistance movement centered on settlements. The network of secret groups covered almost all the major cities of Ukraine. Among them were those who acted alone and those managed by the centers.</p>
<p>In early 1942 intensified its activities and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. There is hope that Germany and the Soviet Union znekrovlyat each other, and Ukraine will be a chance for independent existence. During 1942 the OUN created its own guerrilla army, and she joined forces Bandera, Melnyk and soldiers of the former "Polish Sich". It was called the militias Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). The date of its creation see October 14, 1942 The first commander of the UPA Dmitry Klyachkivskyy (Klim Saur), and in the autumn of 1943 led UPA Shuhevich (Taras Chuprynka).</p>
<p>The faster moving west line of German-Soviet front, the guerrilla warfare became splintered. However, the feud between Ukrainian, Polish and Soviet partisans (as they all fought for different values), was not in favor of the Resistance movement as a whole.</p>
