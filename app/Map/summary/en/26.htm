<p>Mechanical engineering along with energy and chemical industry is included in the so-called avant-garde top three industries, ensuring the development of scientific and technical progress. Modern machinery is composed of more than 200 branches. On the map, "Mechanical Engineering and Metal" presented their separate groups. So, heavy machinery produces technological equipment industries: mining, energy, iron and steel industry. It also includes heavy engineering machine tools and agricultural machinery. These industries are oriented mainly on the consumer and the areas of ferrous metallurgy.</p>
<p>Automotive, railway engineering, shipbuilding, aircraft and missile industry relate to transport engineering. Production of different vehicles are labor intensive, so gravitate to large cities with the availability of skilled manpower.</p>
<p>Precision engineering combines skill- and labor-intensive instrumentation, electrical and electronics industries. Leadership in production of precision engineering belongs to highly developed countries, and in the production of household appliances is dominated by newly industrialized countries of Asia and China.</p>
<p>The high level of engineering and metal are the Group of Eight countries, Russia and most of Europe. Here are concentrated the largest centers of engineering. In the world identify core engineering areas:</p>
<p></p>
<p>North America (30% of world production);</p>
<p></p>
<p>Western Europe (30%);</p>
<p></p>
<p>East and South-East Asia (20%);</p>
<p></p>
<p>Russia and other CIS countries.</p>
