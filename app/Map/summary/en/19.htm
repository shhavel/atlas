<p><b>Horizon. Position of the Sun in the sky at different times of the year.</b></p>
<p>The horizon is called the earth's surface, which man sees around him. Imaginary line where the sky seems connected with the surface of the Earth is called the horizon line. The higher rise above the Earth's surface, the horizon expands, and the line is removed.</p>
<p>During the day high above the earth's surface the sun is at noon. People have long noticed that the height of the sun at this time of day, in different seasons are different. Day, when the height of the sun at noon in the northern hemisphere the largest (June 22), called the day of the summer solstice, and the time when the height of the sun at noon smallest - the day of the winter solstice (December 22). 21 March and 23 September is set equal length of day and night. This date vernal and autumnal equinoxes, respectively. These changes are repeated year after year and they are caused by the Earth's rotation on its axis and around the sun in an orbit.</p>
