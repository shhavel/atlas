<p>In the second half of the XIX century. The Ottoman Empire, Persia (Iran), Siam (Thailand) and China are trapped in a semi-colonial dependence on major powers. They were divided into spheres of influence, and local rulers have become puppets are entirely dependent on the colonizers. Only the rivalry between the great powers themselves prevented their conversion to ordinary prison.</p>
<p>This state of the predetermined states of the forced involvement in the global market, which will inevitably impact on the domestic life. Traditional economic system and political structure began to rapidly deteriorate. Of course, neither the rulers nor the people did not want to be just observers, as their fate is decided. The ruling elite understood that this state of affairs lies in the military and technical backwardness of their countries. They drew on technical advances, the European manner pereozbroyuvaly Army created its own industry, tried to fight against some traditions which, in their opinion, hindered development.</p>
<p>In the Ottoman Empire, these reforms were called tanzimat ("conversion") in China - a policy the self in Iran - Tahi reform Khan.</p>
<p>However, these and other reforms had the desired outcome: age traditions were slow to adapt to a changing world, and the reforms have not been consistent. Finally, it was over crash.</p>
<p>The inability of the ruling elite to resist European penetration, further exacerbated most of the population, defeat natural anti-appearances ("Boxer Rebellion" in China in 1899) stipulated that the struggle led by revolutionaries, who borrowed from various European revolutionary doctrine, tried to raise the peaceful masses to fight against the colonialists and their supporters in their countries.</p>
<p>The awakening of Asia affected by three revolutions: Iran (1905-1911 gg.) Molodoturetskoyu (1908) and Xinhai (1911-1912.). Although the latter two won, but the Iranian was defeated, they led to a diametrically opposite result: the jerk of inertia did not happen, and the raging masses did not want to change the European spirit, the company split into two antagonistic camps-minded (as supporters and opponents of change). This caused new conflicts and revolutions.</p>
<p>The Iranian revolution was the first in Asia in the XX century. Its causes include: a sharp decline in living standards and the aggravation of the food problem; dominion a despotic regime Kadzharskoyi dynasty; dominance of foreign capital - especially English and Russian. Great influence on the revolution had burst revolutionary events in Russia.</p>
<p>The revolution started in late 1905 mass demonstrations in Tehran, Shiraz, Mashhad and other cities. Under the pressure of popular uprisings Shah conceded. October 7, 1906 was convened by the Majlis (Parliament), which adopted a constitution.</p>
<p>Against the deepening of the revolution jointly by Britain and Russia, who were afraid of losing their position in the country. So they supported the coup that made the Shah in June 1908 This development only gave new impetus to the revolution. The mass insurgency especially in the north led to the overthrow of Mohammad Ali Shah and restore the constitution. New Ahmad Shah in subsequent transformations sought US support. The reforms that have been carried out with the help of American advisers M. Schuster, helped consolidate the gains of the revolution and stabilize the regime. But it did not suit Britain and Russia, who resorted to open military aggression. The revolution was suppressed, and Iran turned into a semi-colony.</p>
<p>At the beginning of XX century. The Ottoman Empire was going through hard times. After repeated defeats in the wars of the European powers in the XVIII-XIX centuries. it has lost any influence on world politics. His vast possessions in Europe, Asia and Africa it maintained only because the great powers could not agree on their division. The power of the Sultan lost credibility.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, there was a movement Young Turks - young military officers, intellectuals - who were indifferent to the fate of the country. Before they set a goal - to restore the constitution of 1876, to reform and modernize the society on the European model.</p>
<p>The only thing that has caused divisions among road users - the national question. In addition to the empire of the Turks lived in many other nations, which in the past were conquered and subjected to national oppression.</p>
<p>July 3, 1908 Young Turks revolted. Sultan Abdul-Hamid II hastened to proclaim the restoration of the constitution and gave the Young Turks government. But they Dostupyvshys to power, did not rush to reform, nepokoyuchys the possible disintegration of the empire. Taking advantage of their inaction, the Sultan tried to restore its sole power, but failed. A new sultan Mehmed II began.</p>
<p>Young Turks remained in power until 1918 During his reign, they have not fulfilled promises to modernize the country and get rid of European economic dominance. Instead, only managed to eliminate most barbaric methods of governance launched parliamentary and constitutional norms. However, they do them repeatedly violated.</p>
<p>To divert popular discontent against himself, Young Turks began to fan racial discrimination, shifting the blame for the failure of the Armenians, Greeks and Slavs.</p>
<p>The authority of the Young Turks was blown up and losing the war with Italy (1911-1912 gg.) Balkan Union (1912).</p>
<p>Consequently, the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 failed in its main task - to modernize the Ottoman Empire. Empire began to collapse, and its economy came under the full control of foreign capital. Mostly German.</p>
<p>China, with its population of many millions, and a thousand years of history, especially a painful spreading in the European domination. Manchu Dynasty proved unable to withstand not only Europeans, but also Japan. The country began to fall apart. Then, led the national liberation movement became revolutionaries led by Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>The revolution began October 10, 1911 in Wuhan (known as the three cities - Wuchang, Hankou, Hanyang) and quickly spread to other cities. Manchu dynasty in search of salvation addressed to the General Authority Shikaya Yuan, who was in exile. He agreed, but soon removed the Emperor from power. Power Yuan Shikaya spread north China, supporters of the revolution - to the south. December 29, 1911 in Nanjing delegation revolutionary provinces proclaimed the formation of the Republic of China, interim president was elected by Sun Yat-sen. Split the country was facing the threat of civil war. To avoid Sun Yat-sen gave authorities Yuan Shikayu, who became president.</p>
<p>China has experienced rapid year, which is called the Lunar synhay. Xinhai Revolution in China was over. In March 1912 in Nanjing constitution was adopted and the Republic of China decided to move the capital to Beijing.</p>
<p>Awakening Asia also affected India, where powerful national liberation movement led by the Indian National Congress (INC), preferred non-violent methods of struggle. Peaceful protests, demonstrations, boycott, civil disobedience were no less effective than armed struggle. Its peak in this period was the political strike in Bombay in 1908</p>
<p>Notable among Asian countries occupied Japan. In the middle of the XIX century. after forcible "opening" it faces the prospect of becoming a colony of the great powers. However, due to the consolidation of the nation, reforms, known as the Meiji Revolution ("new rule"), Japan has changed dramatically, and the beginning of XX century. she entered the large states. Reforms in Japan, followed by the outer expansion. The first victim of Japanese aggression became Korea, which Japan in 1876 imposed an unequal treaty. Further expansion of the Japanese encountered the opposition of China and Russia. Cleverly playing on the contradictions between Russia and England, Japan signed an alliance with the latter. In 1875 between Russia and Japan have signed an agreement by which first went out on. Sakhalin, and the second - the Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>Milestones in the development of Japan was the Japanese-Chinese war of 1894-1895 years. Having in her victory, Japan received first colony - the island of Taiwan. Resulting from China's contribution was to finance 10-year program of development of heavy industry, which was to give new weapons. Navy planned to increase by 4 times, 2 times the army. Implemented measures have yielded results, so only 5 years were built 3 thousand. New businesses. In 1900, Japan along with other major powers involved in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion ("Boxer Rebellion") in China. The next step is Japan, which has further strengthened its new status, was the victory in the war with Russia (1904-1905). This victory allowed to establish themselves permanently in Korea (in 1910 became a colony) and China. Believing in its greatness and invincibility of the ruling circles of Japan began nurturing plans for further expansion in the Far East and the Pacific.</p>
