<p>Total reserves of water on Earth is more than 1 387 million cubic km., But of which only 2.5% is fresh water sushi (pie chart). Composition of fresh waters of the world is presented in a cylindrical diagram. Really usable is a small part of the waters of rivers and freshwater lakes. A significant part of the same volume of fresh water located in underdeveloped and remote areas.</p>
<p>The distribution of the world's fresh water resources is uneven and depends on the geographical location and natural conditions of the territory.</p>
<p>The world's fresh water can not be increased, however, the water consumption is constantly increasing, the water becomes contaminated and unusable. Therefore, the planet is already a problem of shortage of fresh water. Water scarcity has yet regional. Especially it feel dry and arid areas where resourced full river flow per capita of less than 5 thousand. Cubic meters. per year. Farming in these areas is possible only on irrigated land.</p>
<p>There are several ways to solve the problem of water scarcity:</p>
<p>- Reducing the cost of water in agriculture;</p>
<p>-introduction industry shallow and waterless technologies recirculation (reuse of waste water);</p>
<p>- Seawater desalination, water use icebergs;</p>
<p>- Construction of reservoirs, river flow.</p>
<p>In a world built over 60 thousand water reservoirs. The largest of them are shown on the map.</p>
