<p>Environmental problems - the problems caused by human interaction with the environment.</p>
<p>In the second polovnyk twentieth century. due to excessive human impact on nature in many countries and regions of the world environmental situation reached the level of environmental crisis. Ecological crisis - a stress state between man and nature as much human nature begins to change dramatically negative impact on social development, and endanger the existence of the human species. This is the opposite condition in which humanity is subject to timely respond adequately can still remedy the situation.</p>
<p>The map shows the area that according to the criteria of environmental assessment referred to areas of ecological crisis: ocean areas contaminated due to transport petroleum products and other forms of economic activity, industrial waste disposal areas in the oceans, reducing the area of ​​forest areas as a result of industrial cutting out in the northern hemisphere and areas destruction of tropical forests, the areas most at risk of desertification.</p>
<p>State environmental crisis is typical for most major cities - industrial and transportation center of the world. It almost destroyed the natural landscape and recorded extremely high levels of contamination of environmental components.</p>
<p>By areas of radioactive contamination include areas nuclear testing: Pacific atolls, the Gobi desert (China), State of Nevada in the United States, about. Novaya Zemlya (Russia), place of burial of radioactive waste and the place where the accident suffered a nuclear ship, as well as areas that have been contaminated as a result of a nuclear accident (USA, Russia, Ukraine).</p>
<p>The world, unfortunately, is a territory whose state can be described as an ecological catastrophe - an abnormal state of nature, arising as a result of human activity, and leads to extremely negative consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality. An example of local ecological disaster zone is the Chernobyl accident (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) and the Ural region (Russia), where in the last decades of the twentieth century. resulting from depletion and pollution of water and air dramatically worsened the living conditions of the population.</p>
<p>Environmental issues related to all mankind. Therefore, they can only solve together. In 1992 the International Environmental Forum representatives of 179 countries have taken important document today - Programme of Action of humanity in the twentieth century. In outlining the ways of international cooperation in this century, aimed at improving environmental quality and a high standard of living planet.</p>
