<p>In 1768-1771 gg., A half century after Abel Tasman, English navigator James Cook discovered Australia and Eastern began its colonization. Its modern name "Australia" ("South") received only continent in 1814</p>
<p>During his voyage, Cook proved that New Zealand - two islands separated by a strait, not part of the unknown southern continent. However, James Cook explored actively pryantarktychni latitude. In the 1772-1775 biennium. He made a trip around the world about the latitude of Cape Horn, along the verge of drifting ice. Cook expedition was the first in the history of seafaring crossed the Antarctic Circle. Although only some hundred miles then separated from Antarctica Cook, he was convinced that there was no space where I could be continent, unless near the pole in places inaccessible to shipping.</p>
<p>During the third expedition Cook were investigated area along the American coast Berynґovoyi Strait and discovered the Hawaiian Islands, where he was killed in a skirmish with the natives.</p>
<p>In 1802, Lieutenant-Commander of the Russian Navy Ivan Krusenstern proposed a circumnavigation for direct trade links between the Russian port on the Baltic Sea and Alaska. He was appointed head of the first Russian round-the expedition, which in August 1803 for two sailing "Nadezhda" and "Neva" set off from Kronstadt. The first ship commanded by Krusenstern itself, the second - his colleague, Ukrainian by birth, George Lysyansky. Among the officers of the expedition was still young Thaddeus Bellingshausen. In March 1804 the ship rounded Cape Horn, and in three weeks the common swimming near Hawaii dispersed. "Neva" went to the coast of Alaska, and the "Nadezhda" arrived in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, where went on a diplomatic mission in Nagasaki. In 1805 were investigated shores of Sakhalin Island, and the north-west coast of North America, and in 1806 the ships met, returned to Kronstadt. Generally during this expedition was opened Equatorial Counter Current in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, conducted important research and collected numerous data on the state of water, atmospheric pressure, tides in different parts of the oceans.</p>
<p>Do not stop searching for the southern polar lands. Farthest away and the most severe in nature continent - Antarctica was discovered in Russian expedition (1819-1821 gg.), Headed by Mikhail Lazarev and Thaddeus Bellingshausen. On the ship "Vostok" and "Mirny" in January 1820 was reached the shores of the ice continent, and one of the places naynedostupnishyh Antarctica.</p>
<p>The first attempt to conquer the North Pole made the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen on the ship "Fram". Planning an expedition, Nansen did not expect that the ship will pass exactly through the pole, he intended to leave the ship and walk to the pole on foot. September 22, 1893 started traveler "Fram" in the icy environment, giving him vmerznuty, and when the ice zimknuvsya under the ship, as he lay on the ice sheets, began to drift, which lasted eighteen months. March 14, 1895, Nansen left the ship to dog sled continue your journey north. April 8th he reached 86 ° 14 'N latitude - the northernmost point where a person reaches. However, due to lack of food and other essential items, the traveler had to turn back before reaching the pole.</p>
<p>The first lucky enough to reach the North Pole was Robert Peary - American traveler, explorer. It happened on April 6, 1909. His expedition was in full support of naval forces of the United States. The conquest of the North Pole has always been the main goal of Robert Peary, he tried to make during his four previous Arctic expeditions. As a result of one of these famous American first expressed his belief that Greenland is an island.</p>
<p>In addition Peary North Pole tried to open and Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, one of the most important achievements of determination of the geomagnetic North Pole. However, learning that has conquered the North Pole, Amundsen has directed all its efforts on achieving the southernmost point of the Earth. August 9, 1910 at the renowned ship Fridtjof Nansen "Fram" Norwegian went to Antarctica. And actually to the South Pole expedition set off October 20, 1911. However, here he was a rival - English explorer Robert Scott, who two years before conducted research in Antarctica. Scott has calculated that to achieve the South Pole and return back he will need 145 days. With vehicles Scott most relied on horses and tractors, not paying enough attention to the dogs. He went on tour November 2, 1911. However it is achieved Pole Amundsen first successfully through the selected route and, more importantly, the use of dog upryazhok. It happened on December 14, 1911. While the British expedition through various unforeseen circumstances and difficulties made it only January 17, 1912. Turning back, all five British explorers died. On the way Robert Scott kept a diary, in which the last entry was made March 29. Body of travelers found only eight months the search expedition. In his suicide note Captain Scott wrote: "The causes lesions not caused by deficiencies in the organization, but failed in those risky activities, which we had to take." Amundsen successfully returned from his Antarctic expedition, after which still has the air of Arctic research.</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century there was a dire need for development of eastern sea route, although the possibility of using prypuskalasya since the sixteenth century. For the first time the route has been passed from one wintering expedition in 1878-79 years the Swedish explorer Nils Nordenskjold on the schooner "Vega". And do it for the first time managed to navigate a Russian polar expedition, headed by Otto Schmidt in 1932, a little more than two months was overcome by the mouth of the Northern Dvina to Berynґovoyi Strait. Besides the already mentioned results of two expeditions Schmidt began opening Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago and other islands, as well as microbiological, mapping, oceanographic research, initiated a comprehensive study and development of strict land.</p>
<p>A significant event in the history of seafaring was piracy, which originated in the Mediterranean during ancient times. The main craft pirate of all ages has been a prey of merchant ships. However, there were some pirates, which can be put on a par with the most famous travelers and explorers. Among them, the second round traveler Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish, who went round the Earth third ocean in history. William Dampier in his wanderings three rounded the globe and delivered from the bondage sailor on a desert island, which became the prototype of Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe's novel. Do not shun pirate craft brave pioneers northern areas Normans. In general, the pirates opened many small islands in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and near Australia.</p>
<p>It happened in the history of pirates became a tool in the military-political confrontation leading powers. In the early sixteenth century, the Spaniards closed to all foreign ships access to the sea that washed their overseas possessions. By the time the Spanish navy was the strongest in the world. Such a policy could not cause the protests of other maritime powers of Europe, and their main weapon in this confrontation became pirates. First, an active struggle with Spain, plundering its trading galleon in the Caribbean, led by French pirates, encouraged their king. Then they were joined by the British. The most famous pirates of that time was Francis Drake, whose actions with the blessing of Queen Elizabeth caused a significant loss of the Spaniards, and Thomas Cavendish. British pirate attacks made a considerable "contribution" to defeat Invincible Armada - Navy sent the Spanish King Philip II to conquer England. One hundred years in the Caribbean dominated is another Englishman - the legendary John Morgan.</p>
<p>Piracy in the Indian Ocean can be divided into two stages. The first lasted until the arrival of Europeans here, the second - a European. Actors were the first Arab and Malay pirates who do not go beyond coastal waters. Pirates first Europeans here were the Portuguese, subsequently joined the British and the Dutch.</p>
