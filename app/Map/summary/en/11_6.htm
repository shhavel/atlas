<p>Before the new year hopes of the German command to rescue the encircled slick passing moves failed. But the battle of Stalingrad continued for over a month and ended February 2, 1943 the complete destruction of the enemy. This catastrophic defeat of Germany has identified all the further course of the war.</p>
<p>In January, the Soviet army launched an offensive across the front line from Voronezh to the Caucasus. From Nazis were released vast areas. By February 18, Soviet troops entered the Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, Kursk, Belgorod. February 14 Germans left Vorochilovgrad and 16 February - Kharkiv.

<p>Building on the success in September, Soviet troops liberated the Donbass and the Left Bank and went to the Dnieper. At the same time held overhaul of Soviet troops. Voronezh Front was renamed the 1st Ukrainian (Commander Nikolai Vatutin), Steppe Front - on the 2nd Ukrainian (commanded by Ivan Konev), Southwest - the 3rd Ukrainian Front (commanded by Rodion Malinovsky), Southern - the 4th Ukrainian Front (commanded by Fedor Tolbukhina).</p>
<p>September 21 began a battle for the Dnieper, which the Nazis turned into a basic element of a strong defensive line, called "East axis." Defense on the Dnieper kept the German Army Group "Center" (Belarus), "South" and "A" (Ukraine). The troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front was able to capture a bridgehead on the right bank of the river, near the Great Bukryna. But to develop the offensive in this area proved too difficult.

<p>The inevitable defeat of Germany became apparent. And the further the front line moved westward, the more raised the question of the future government of Poland and western regions.

The territory of Moldova was carried them Iasi-Chisinau operation to encircle and defeat the German-Romanian Army Group "South Ukraine" (20 - 29 August). As a result, Romania surrendered (August 24) and joined the anti-Hitler bloc.</p>
<p>October 8 was released last point of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in its pre-war boundaries - Lavochne village in the Carpathians. Immediately after Soviet troops crossed the mountain. October 27, with battles was won Uzhgorod and the war spilled over into the territory of the German satellites - Hungary and Slovakia.</p>
