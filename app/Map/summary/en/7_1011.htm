<p><b>1. The establishment in Kiev</b></p>
<p>Vladimir established in Kyiv 980., Already having considerable experience statesman. With stories chronicler learn that he began to reign in Novgorod, which, however, was expelled older brother Yaropolk.</p>
<p>Stripped of possessions, Vladimir few years wandering in strange lands. The years of exile were not for him nothing, because he returned to Russia with Vladimir troops Normans. With their support, he not only conquered Novgorod, but also possessed lands older brothers, taking, in addition, and Polotsk.</p>
<p>Legendary detail adorned Chronicle story about how Vladimir Toril way to velyknyazivskoho table.</p>
<p>Many trials had to overcome Walter until he, in the words of the chronicler, "began to reign in Kiev alone."</p>
<p><b>2. Formation of the national territory. The territorial division</b></p>
<p>Characteristics of the Kievan princes - Vladimir predecessors were quite conventional.</p>
<p>Each of the Kievan rulers had to make extraordinary efforts to renew its authority over the unruly tribal princes.</p>
<p>To stable domains of Svyatoslav, no matter how great were his temporary conquest, belonged only to Kyiv with the surrounding lands, territories and derevlyansku Novgorod.</p>
<p>When Vladimir Kyiv took over his power extended to own the land and the earth just conquered Polotsk residents.</p>
<p>So he set about to consistently connect to Kyiv new territory is not limited to the establishment of formal superiority in the form of paying tribute.</p>
<p>Kyiv vykorinyuvav owner of the lands of the conquered tribes any signs of local tribal authorities, transferring them into the possession of his sons or government officials-mayor.</p>
<p>Subordinated territory lost tribal names instead of their lands gradually began to call for a major city: Kiev land, Chernigov land Pereyaslavskaya land Novgorod land and so on.</p>
<p>During the reign of Vladimir the Great was replaced tribal division of Kievan Rus territorial.</p>
<p>Regarding territorial gains Vladimir striking vidsunennya tangible boundaries of the Kievan state in the west.</p>
<p>In 981 Vladimir captured the cities of Przemysl, Volyn, June and Belz.</p>
<p>By Volodymyr's holdings included and Transcarpathia.</p>
<p>Because of the northern territory of Kyiv prince had access to the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>Not waning interest while Vladimir and to the south, because the Byzantine Empire remained the most powerful state, and eastern nomadic world was so close that it meant deliberately neglected exposed to the danger of devastation.</p>
<p>These circumstances prompted the prince of Kiev to strengthen its position on the Taman Peninsula - in Tmutarakan ground that it was attached to the Kievan prince Svyatoslav state.</p>
<p>Note! The large expanse of state Vladimir indicate that an important role among the events of Prince played military marches. Annals and really gives them a lot, dating, however, mostly first years of the reign of Volodymyr.</p>
<p>Modern scholars are inclined to believe that those campaigns would have to be much larger and apparently they took place during the reign of Prince Vladimir. However, in the absence of other sources in the historical literature are mostly the date certified by the chronicler.</p>
<p><b>During the reign of Volodymyr Kyiv conquered huge territories, establishing the boundaries of the state along the Dniester River, Western Bug, Neman, Western Dvina River in the west, rivers Oka and Volga in the east, Peipus, Ladoga and Onega lakes and the Gulf of Finland in the north, the Black Sea and Azov Sea ' I'm in the south. Given the divisions and the abolition of the local tribal authorities, this was no longer namriyana and very real Empire - the largest state of contemporary Europe.</b></p>
<p><b>3. Introduction of Christianity as the state religion. The relationship between government and faith in the Middle Ages</b></p>
<p>In the combined Vladimir lands inhabited by various tribes and peoples. They kept their ancestral customs and traditions, believed in their gods, most of which were different even in the allied tribes, varied language, life, and most remote - and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the territorial unity of the state, supported only by force of arms was quite illusory. To cultivate a mighty empire - namely, the intention was Vladimir - he had to take care of an ideological justification for his rule.</p>
<p>In ancient times it was thought right to govern bestowed by the gods. Such representations was observed by our ancestors. Given the dominance of pagan cults Vladimir endangered constant resistance tribes who worshiped their god each and obey God sanctified by the governor.</p>
<p>Kyiv Prince destroyed tribal princely dynasty, but were gods ... They mouth Magi priests persuaded the people of the resumption of the original order.</p>
<p><b>Volodymyr's empire was incompatible with pagan polytheism. For all the state had to be the one God, who by his will gave the right to govern the Kievan princes.</b></p>
<p><b>Choosing Faith</b></p>
<p>Prince Vladimir happened to live at a time when widespread acquired Christianity.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that among the Ruthenians were many Christians. As Christians we know Princess Olga - Volodymyr's grandmother.</p>
<p>Power to this day have kept the legend of how Vladimir himself carefully and meticulously choosing a new faith for himself and his country.</p>
<p>At first he allegedly tried to dispense with all innovations and undertook to reform paganism.</p>
<p>The chronicler tells us, in particular, Vladimir, being established in Kiev, ordered the prince's palace near the idols of Perun, Hors, Dazhdbog, Stribog, Simargl and Mokosh - the most respected Slavic gods.</p>
<p>These gods, according to the prince, had worshiped all the families. However, the attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Then Vladimir invited representatives of various nations that professed belief in one God - Islam, Judaism, Roman (Catholic) Christianity and the Byzantine, or, as they said, the Greek (Orthodox) Christianity.</p>
<p>After hearing the statement of the principles of each faith, Vladimir even delayed the announcement of his will, although the choice is already made. To definitively ascertain the correct choice, he sent envoys to various countries for the "test of faith".</p>
<p>Just heard a report every prince announced his decision to join the Byzantine Christianity.</p>
<p>In fact, the introduction of Christianity as the state religion was determined by the passage of life.</p>
<p>The intention dubbed Russia, as you recall, had no Prince Askold and Princess Olga. But then a political move not won the support of influential officials.</p>
<p>Also, join the Christian states could only be with the consent of their rulers. The Lord of the Byzantine Empire, for example, felt that after the introduction in some state of Byzantine Christianity, it automatically becomes subordinate Byzantium.</p>
<p>Prince of Kiev, which for centuries competed with Constantinople, it was impossible to ignore this fact.</p>
<p><b>So, according to researchers, chronicles the legend is an echo of complex intergovernmental negotiations that their government is committed to the act of baptism of Vladimir of Russia.</b></p>
<p><b>Chronicles legend of the baptism of Vladimir and introduction of Christianity in Russia.</b></p>
<p>The introduction of Christianity chronicler connected with Vladimir march on the Greek city of Chersonese (Korsun) in Crimea, which belonged then to the Byzantine possessions.</p>
<p>Forcing residents to open the gate, Vladimir turned to the rulers of Byzantium demanding to give him according to his wife their sister.</p>
<p>Marriage prevented paganism prince of Kiev. Baptized at Chersonesos and married with Anna - the so-called Byzantine princess, Vladimir returned to Kyiv.</p>
<p>With a Kyiv prince brought Korsun clergy, books, icons, crosses, relics of Pope St. Clement.</p>
<p>Then he resorted to drastic measures for the baptism of Kyiv residents. Grand Duke sent messengers out of the city the following day to arrive the Dnieper River.</p>
<p>Most Kiev with children came to the river and entered the water. In the presence of Vladimir priests dubbed them.</p>
<p>Conversion to Christianity baptism of Kyiv residents launched throughout the country.</p>
<p><b>The spread of Christianity in Rus' lands</b></p>
<p>The introduction of the new faith required time.</p>
<p>Researchers claim that the Russian Church even in the 12th century. were special places for the baptism of adults.</p>
<p>At first inhabitants to Christianity pryluchalysya largest cities.</p>
<p>Chronicle brings rare evidence of outbreaks dissatisfaction with the actions of the prince. And Vladimir found neshytnu will and determination, therefore, the introduction of Christianity it was, unlike his predecessors Askold and Olga irreversible.</p>
<p>What new faith took on a peaceful supporters, evidenced by the fact that many ancient traditions have remained at home Rus, interwoven with Christian rites.</p>
<p>For example, among carols - velychalnyh songs in honor of the birth of Jesus Christ - and yet many of those encountered during pre-Christian times.</p>
<p><b>Meaning introduction of Christianity as the state religion</b></p>
<p><b>The adoption of Christianity in Rus' had a huge impact on the further development of the state.</b></p>
<p>The direct consequences of the introduction of Christianity in Kievan state in the area of ​​domestic policy include - strengthening the power of the prince of Kiev, closely unite around Kyiv ethnically diverse areas, poverty generated by the local pagan beliefs and attitudes of insularity and isolation from other areas.</p>
<p>In international life consequences of Christianity - to establish equal relations with the Christian countries, mostly from Byzantium.</p>
<p>To the direct effects of Christianity as the state religion belongs foundation Vladimir church organization.</p>
<p>The effects of the measures on the spread of Vladimir education were directly related to the introduction of Christianity, but clearly were a few decades - when in our country flourished literary culture.</p>
<p>Just remote in time was the development of architecture and painting, jewelery and music, without evidence which should not imagine the celebration in the Christian church.</p>
<p>The most distant in time are the consequences of the introduction of Christianity in the realm of human relations. Even today, have not lost their significance guidance of Jesus Christ, his teachings are the foundation of modern civilization.</p>
<p>Our understanding of good and evil, kindness and cruelty, loyalty and betrayal, honor and shame, diligence and laziness, irresponsibility and integrity, righteousness and lawlessness is based on Christian values.</p>
<p>With the adoption of Christianity in our land strengthened family stuck children to respect their parents, a premium has become a female mother. Gradually people learned to be accountable for their actions, because each according to Christian doctrine will be a report about his life before God.</p>
