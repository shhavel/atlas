<p>General features of the earth's surface determined by the characteristics of the tectonic structure, played on the corresponding map. The territory of Ukraine is in the range of 3 major tectonic structures, different in age and structure:</p>
<p>1) Eastern European ancient (Precambrian) platforms;</p>
<p>2) young Scythian (epihertsynskoyi) platform;</p>
<p>3) Ckladchastoho zone of the Carpathians and the Crimea, which is part of the Alpine-Himalayan belt of Eurasia and formed during the Alpine orogeny in the era of the Cenozoic era.</p>
<p>Different tectonic structures on the ground correspond definite forms of relief. Geostructural axis throughout Ukraine is Ukrainian Shield - crystal array, which correspond to the Dnieper and Azov Upland. West of the Shield is the Volyn-Podolsk stove - geostructures, which correspond to Volyn and Podolsk Upland. To the east and south of the Ukrainian shield behind the Dnieper-Donetsk and the Black Sea basin. The latter two correspond to the Dnieper and the Black Sea lowlands.</p>
