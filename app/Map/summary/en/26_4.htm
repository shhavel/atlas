<p>"Cars - in every family", this slogan is a reality in Ukraine. For many of our fellow citizens no longer a luxury car and a normal vehicle. Today, the average Ukrainian can purchase a car, depending on their preferences and wealth. The number of "iron horses" in Ukraine has been growing steadily in Kiev, for example, in 2008 there were already nearly 1 million cars, many of them in the Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk regions. As the number of cars per 1000 inhabitants lead Kyiv and Zaporizhia (the main center of the country's automotive industry).</p>
