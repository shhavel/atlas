<p><b>Basic concepts and terms</b></p>
<p>Early Iron Age - one of the periods of humanity for Three-age system. There is the separation of the Indo-Europeans, technological fractures in the manufacture of tools and weapons, the emergence of the first state formations, the most brilliant period of the existence of nomadic communities. In Ukraine, this day falls on the first millennium BC. - The beginning of the first millennium AD. and chronologically consistent Cimmerian, Scythian and Sarmatian dobam history.</p>
<p><b>Figures</b></p>
<p>Herodotus - a prominent Greek historian. Many traveled to Asia Minor, was in Egypt, Babylon, Phoenicia, Syria, Western Black Sea, Olbia. Author labor conventionally called "history", which is the first broad historical narrative of states and peoples of Asia and Europe. Outlining the various versions, Herodotus showed a critical attitude toward the material collected. Back in the old days of Herodotus called the "father of history". In Hellenistic Alexandria scientists shared a "history" Herodotus Book 9 (the number of Greek music). The fourth book is a valuable source of history, ethnography and geography of the Northern Black Sea.</p>
<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. Early Iron Age</b></p>
<p>The promotion of iron as the most common metal in the lands of Ukraine was held on 7 Art. e. e., as evidenced by the archaeological excavations.</p>
<p>The appearance of iron tools and weapons led to the rapid development of economy and military.</p>
<p>Agricultural tribes began to use iron plow, with which you could plow more land, and consequently - to gather the best yields.</p>
<p>Pastoralists desert by that time began to live a nomadic life, constantly moving with cattle to new lands. They learned to ride horses and overcome these fleet-foot animal vast distances.</p>
<p>With the discovery of iron nomadic pastoralists have become invincible warriors. History of warlike nomads in our lands started Cimmerians.</p>
<p><b>2. Cimmerians</b></p>
<p><b>To sources of the Cimmerians</b></p>
<p>Cimmerians - Iranian nomadic people who prymandruvav of the Lower Volga region in the Black Sea steppes in the 9th century. e. e., and reigned there for two centuries.</p>
<p>Cimmerians - the first nation in our land, whose name is known to us. They saved her written sources, though not of the Cimmerians, as they had no written language, and Assyrians and Greeks.</p>
<p>The earliest mention of the Cimmerians contained in the famous "Odyssey" and most detailed - in the work of Herodotus.</p>
<p>Mysterious and incomprehensible residents were given the Black Sea steppes Greek authors.</p>
<p>Homer, in particular, called them strange mare milker and molokoyidamy, land which odviku "clouds and mloyu vpovyta."</p>
<p>The real features of the Assyrian and Babylonian full testimony of the Cimmerians, since the peoples of the Middle East had to endure their invasion.</p>
<p><b>Cimmerians - soldiers</b></p>
<p>All written mention of the Cimmerians related to their military campaigns.</p>
<p>The army consisted of Cimmerians mobile teams of riders.</p>
<p>According to archaeological finds, for its time, the Cimmerians were unsurpassed masters of military equipment.</p>
<p>The main weapon of Cimmerian warriors was a powerful long-range bow. In close combat they used iron swords length of the meter.</p>
<p>On perfect horse equipment Cimmerians evidenced by the fact that he borrowed that time folks.</p>
<p>For the history of the peoples who lived on the lands of Ukraine in ancient times, this fact is significant because it is the Cimmerians were the first among the inhabitants of the steppe learned to produce iron; that's why they associated with the beginning of the Iron Age in our steppe area.</p>
<p><b>Lifestyle Cimmerians</b></p>
<p>Cimmerians were the first people on the Ukrainian territory, which the researchers called nomadic.</p>
<p>Cimmerians do not build homes, and their lives ran in an endless journey across the steppe or on horseback, or in tents pulled by oxen. The basis of their economy was breeding. What they could not give horses Cimmerians conquered.</p>
<p><b>3. Hiking Cimmerians farmers against Forest. Chornoliska culture</b></p>
<p>Military campaigns Cimmerians plagued not only the peoples of the Middle East. Prevalent in the Black Sea steppes, they could not avoid the world farmers Forest. The lands of the middle Dniester River on the west to the middle reaches of the river Vorskla in the east at that time inhabited by numerous tribes of archaeologists call chornoliska native culture.</p>
<p>Got its name from the great culture of the Black Forest, in the upper reaches of the river Makarov, where it was found it of interest.</p>
<p>Archaeological finds show that they grew millet, barley, rye, and wheat. Harvest collected bronze sickles and kept it in special holes made in the floor dwellings.</p>
<p>Grains going enough to keep a large number of pigs. In addition, chornolistsi bred cows, goats, sheep and horses.</p>
<p>But most impressive skill Chornolisky blacksmiths. Archaeologists lucky to find a steel sword length 108 cm.</p>
<p>The first attacks of the Cimmerians chornolistsi suffered already from the beginning of their rule in the Barrens. And most acute in this confrontation was 8 st. e. e. At that time there was a powerful defensive line with many castles, settlements along Tyasmyn, and in the Black Forest - surrounded with three rows of walls and ditches mound.</p>
<p>Fight against the Cimmerians was brutal attacks of the nomads ended mostly destructive fire, many chornolistsiv got captured.</p>
<p>Numerous archeological finds show that the end of 8 cent. e. e. Cimmerians overcome resistance Chornolisky population, penetrated deep into their land and took possession of the most important settlements.</p>
<p>Consequently, among chornolistsiv have spread things Cimmerian sample, especially weapons and horse gear. But even that seemed invincible warriors Cimmerians in the 7th century. e. e. theirdomination urvalosya in the desert, and they scattered, subjugated much more powerful tribes of the Scythians.</p>
<p><b>4. The Scythians, resettlement and employment</b></p>
<p>In the Black Sea steppes they prymandruvaly from the steppe regions of the Caucasus. As Cimmerians, Scythians were nomads, based economy which was breeding.</p>
<p>Similarly, they had the experience of trekking to the country of Asia Minor. However, narazyvshys on stubborn resistance, had to change the direction of campaigns for prey.</p>
<p>As Cimmerians were Iranian. Thus, having won Cimmerian tribes, they form a single nomadic horde, which has quickly become one people.</p>
<p>Since the Scythians were nomadic, they have left behind settlements. The only monuments of their lives is the grave-mounds.</p>
<p>Scythians believed that man's death means the end of her earthly life and the beginning of the underworld.</p>
<p>Tombs of the Scythians wealthy oblashtovuvalys as underground shelter. Deep wells are constructed of wood several premises that are called catacombs.</p>
<p>Deceased was placed there, dressed in nayoshatnishyy clothes, which he had for life, jewelery and weapons, put together dishes dishes and drinks.</p>
<p>Along with the master was his war-horse gear in slaves.</p>
<p>On top of an underground shelter overlap boards and poured over it mound. What shanovanishym was dead, the higher mound poured over his grave.</p>
<p>Poorer Scythians buried without major honors in conventional wells.</p>
<p>Scythians considered the inventors of complex long-range bow, an arrow from the skillful warrior who could send over a distance of 500 m. It is these grasslands used by nomadic peoples of Eurasia during the 1st millennium BC. E. e.</p>
<p><b>5. Great Scythia</b></p>
<p><b>The territory and its inhabitants</b></p>
<p>At the time of greatest power Scythians extended power to many neighboring nations. 5-4 c. e. e. reached their heyday state. Scientists have agreed to call it Great Scythia.</p>
<p>The territory of Great Scythia, according to Herodotus, was a huge square, south side which stretches along the Black Sea from the Danube to the Sea of ​​Azov. Under its northern border would prolyahty roughly along the Pripyat through Chernigov, Kursk and on to Voronezh.</p>
<p>Those lands, says the Greek historian, and was inhabited by Scythian tribes neskifski. By the Scythian tribes, Herodotus actually counted Scythians (nomadic Scythians), the Royal Scythians, Scythians tillers, Scythian farmers.</p>
<p>In the Black Sea steppes inhabited by nomadic Scythians and Royal Scythians. As for the territories inhabited by the Scythians, a farmer and Scythian farmers, researchers have argued for a long time. Today, the dominant view that the Scythians Pahari lived in the steppe zone of Right-Bank Ukraine, and Scythian farmers - the Left.</p>
<p>Iranian Scythians were nomadic and Royal Scythians. They are, in fact, prevailed in the Great Scythia conquering other tribes. On the greatness of the Scythian state of the time show royal burial mounds - the magnificent funerary monuments of the most influential and wealthiest Scythians.</p>
<p>Most of them opened in the Lower Dnieper. The most famous are mounds Chortomlyk, Solokha, Gaymanova Tomb, Tomb Thick and others.</p>
<p>Fabulous luxury linens royal burial mounds created the work of many people, who inhabited Scythia.</p>
<p>An important source of enrichment for the Royal Scythians were Scythians land-tillers and Scythian farmers.</p>
<p>As the name that Herodotus gave it to the tribes, they were farmers. Scythians-tiller wheat grown not only for domestic consumption but also for sale.</p>
<p><b>Scythian king Atey</b></p>
<p>Highest elevation reached in Great Scythia 4. e. e. the time of Tsar Ateius.</p>
<p>From Greek sources learn that the king-warrior won all his power the Scythian lands from the Danube to the Don.</p>
<p>Evidence might Ateius was chasing it's own coins.</p>
<p>Atey led an active expansionist policy. This caused the confrontation with Great Scythia Macedonian state, which was then gaining strength and sought new lands.</p>
<p>In the battle against the Macedonians, led by King Philip (father of Alexander the Macedonian) 339 BC. E. e. Atey centenary died.</p>
<p><b>The Decline of Great Scythia</b></p>
<p>In 4-3 centuries. e. e. Scythia situation suddenly deteriorated. Without irretrievably gone steppe Scythian monuments.</p>
<p>The reasons for the decline of the Scythian state researchers believe dry steppes, the decline of the economic life of the forest-steppe through the brutal use of its resources.</p>
<p>Great Scythia ceased to exist.</p>
<p>However, the Scythians themselves disappeared from the historical arena, they turned south and set up two small Scythia. First - in the Lower Danube, the second - in the foothill and steppe Crimea, with its capital of Naples.</p>
<p><b>The spiritual world of the Great Scythia</b></p>
<p>The people of Great Scythia had no written language. On their inner world learn from the Scythian jewelry, tableware, as well as the stories of the Greeks.</p>
<p>Glassware, weapons, ornaments decorated with scenes from Scythian their myths and legends. Therefore, a careful study of them allows you to restore the Scythian mythology.</p>
<p>The image of the gods kept on Scythian monuments. Uniqueness gives them "animal style". For the decoration of weapons and household items Scythians used images of deer, sheep, horses, panthers, leopards, lions, birds and fish. There are also images of fantastic creatures - winged griffins lions and torso with hryfobaraniv.</p>
<p>They put the Scythians and stone sculptures - tops mounds. Stone vyrubalysya schematic male figure, which sometimes cut facial features, arms, details of clothing and weapons.</p>
<p><b>6. Sarmatians</b></p>
<p>In the 3rd century. e. e. the Scythians in the Black Sea steppes took the Sarmatians. These are related to the Scythians Iranian nomads came from the Ural-Volga steppes.</p>
<p>As they called themselves, the science is unknown. Name "Sarmatians" they called the Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p>Scientists assume that the name comes from davnoiranskoho word "saoromant", meaning "girded with the sword."</p>
<p>Remember that along with the ethnonym "Sarmatians' ancient writers used the other; This is because the Sarmatians lived in tribes, each having its own name, such as Yazigi, Roksolany, Sirak, aorsy, Alans and others.</p>
<p>Life and Life Sarmatians were similar to Scythian. They are just like the Scythians were nomadic pastoralists. Similarly, many of them meant for military campaigns. Ancient sources detailed account of equipment Sarmatians, their militancy.</p>
<p>This is evidence, moreover, clearly indicates the participation Sarmatians in contemporary European events.</p>
<p>As an active military force were involved, including the war against Rome. Not disdain to attack and their families on less affluent residents forest steppe: 1 c. e. e. in Sarmatian graves there are few things natives of the Dnieper region - captured and enslaved.</p>
<p>Sarmatian domination in the Black Sea steppes lasted almost 600 years. Put an end Germanic tribes of Goths and invasion of new nomads - Turkic Huns.</p>
