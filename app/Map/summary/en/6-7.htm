<p><b>Physical map of Ukraine</b></p>
<p>The main forms of the earth's surface is plain and mountains.</p>
<p>Plains - a land area that have a flat surface. They are divided into lowland and upland.</p>
<p>In northern Ukraine, located Plain Woodland. The surface of the marsh, mostly of low rise - hills. To the northeast is the Dnieper Lowland. Its territory is hilly with lots of ravines and gullies. South also holds the Black Sea lowlands.</p>
<p>In Ukraine there are hills, Volyn, Podolia, Dnieper, Donetsk and Azov.</p>
<p>Jar - is a large recess with steep slopes on Earth, formed as a result of leaching of soil draining rain water. Ravines destroy the Earth. When the slopes of ravines overgrown with plants, they turn into beams.</p>
<p>Mountains - a section of the earth's surface, lifted high above the plains. Several mountains are called mountain ranges. The mountains are low (500 to 800 m), medium (800 to 2,000 m) and high (above 2000 m).</p>
<p>In the western part of our country reach the average height and rounded peaks of the Carpathian Mountains. Their highest peak (Goverla) has a height of 2061 m. A Roman-Kosh Mountain (altitude: 1545 m) is the highest peak of the Crimean Mountains, overlooking the peninsula.</p>
<p>Ponds land (sea, rivers, lakes, swamps, springs, ponds and reservoirs), which arose naturally called natural and man-made - artificial.</p>
<p>Sea - a part of the ocean that cuts into the land. Salt water in them, as in the oceans. In the south Ukraine is washed by the Black Sea, and from the south-east - Azov. These seas are connected by the Kerch Strait.</p>
<p>River - a stream of water that has leaked (source, lake, swamp or glacier) - a place where it begins. Burying through which flows the river is called the channel. The place where the river empties into another body of water - the mouth. But the rest of the river, whose waters flow into the main river - a tributary. Each river has left and right banks.</p>
<p>For large lowland rivers in Ukraine are the Dnieper, which carries the waters from north to south. Its major tributaries: the River Pripyat, Desna, Psyol Vorskla, Samara. In the south of the Danube ends its way. A Dniester has its roots in the Carpathian mountains. Also, the large rivers</p>
<p>Ukraine belong to the Southern Bug and the Seversky Donets.</p>
<p>Lake - a body of water that occurs in natural cavities on the surface of the Earth and is replenished by water year, ground water sources, rain and melt water. They are different in size, depth, fresh or salt water. Sometimes they form a whole country.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, about 20 thousand lakes. The rich lowland lakes Woodland known Shatsky famous lakes. In the Carpathians, the most famous lake Sinevir. Many lakes formed by the Danube - the largest fresh water lake Yalpuh, the deepest Cahul. Salt Lake rich Crimea.</p>
<p>The most famous - Lagoon.</p>
<p>Swamp - area too damp earth's surface.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the largest wetlands on Polisskiy lowlands.</p>
<p>Source - a place where the Earth's surface flows underground water. Power generated at the bottom of ravines, gullies, on slopes of hills, steep river banks.</p>
<p><b>Minerals</b></p>
<p>Minerals - a mineral, minerals or rocks used in the household.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits on the map indicated by the signs. Each has its minerals symbol.</p>
<p>Since minerals are deposited in the ground at different depths, so extract them in different ways. In open-pit mined minerals that lie close to the surface of the earth, and for minerals from the depths of the mine and build wells.</p>
