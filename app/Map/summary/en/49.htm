<p>Australia, New Zealand and the islands of different sizes and origins in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, owing to the generality of geography and historical development, combined in some regions - Australia and Oceania.</p>
<p>Australia - the industrialized countries, which plays an important role throughout the Asia-Pacific area. The largest state in Oceania - Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. Many islands are possessions of the United States, Britain, France, Australia and New Zealand. Australia, New Zealand and some islands of Oceania are included in the British Commonwealth of Nations.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand - a country of resettlement of capitalism, their development took place during the crucial role of the mother country and European immigrants formed the nucleus of the future of nations.</p>
<p>These countries (like South Africa and Canada) are still raw regions of the world economy. Other countries of Oceania are developing. Their main property is the natural conditions and strategic location. The main sectors of the economy - the cultivation of tropical crops, fisheries and tourism.</p>
<p>Primary cultures of crop - coconut, sugar cane, bananas, fruits and vegetables. For 3/4 of all island countries of Oceania main export product is copra - product processing coconuts. Exported seafood. Some countries are developing and minerals: copper, gold (Papua New Guinea), Nickel (New Caledonia), phosphates (Nauru).</p>
<p>New Zealand - an agrarian-industrial country with a well-developed agriculture. Livestock - the leading industry (presence of natural grassland), characterized by a high level of mechanization, marketability and high performance. New Zealand is one of the world's largest suppliers of meat (beef, lamb, poultry), butter, cheese and wool.</p>
<p>Australia (Commonwealth) occupies the entire mainland Australia about. Tasmania and several small islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Modern Australia - economically developed industrial-agrarian country. In the global economy, it acts as a supplier of raw materials and foodstuffs; plays a significant role in world production and trade in wheat, meat, sugar, and wool and mineral raw materials (iron ore, coal, manganese ores, uranium, bauxite, nickel, bismuth, gold).</p>
<p>The leading place in the sectoral structure of the economy belongs to the manufacturing industry (iron and steel, machinery, chemicals, food, textile, printing).</p>
<p>In the territorial structure of the economy stands south-east of the country. Here are concentrated the most big cities, industrial centers and, therefore, there is the highest population density. Hence began development of the continent. Here positioned Sydney - the largest and oldest city, is one of the most important industrial and cultural centers of the country, the modern capital of New South Wales.</p>
<p>At a distance from the coast plains of-state development of intensive agriculture, with dairy cattle grazing on forage grasses and sheep.</p>
<p>In a relatively short period of time Australia took a difficult path of economic development. From agrarian and raw material appendage of the metropolis, which was strange in the beginning of the twentieth century. It became economically highly developed state.</p>
<p>A large role in this was played by close ties with the mother country. Industry, mining, first, and then processed, began to evolve with technology and equipment imported from the Old World. European settlers formed the basis of qualified manpower. Australia has always had a positive migration balance. Every fourth person was born outside Australia. Migration policy facilitates the flow of immigrants.</p>
