<p>The Crimean peninsula is a relatively small area. The area of ​​the Crimea is 26,900 km2. By area, it is 20 times smaller than the Iberian and Balkan peninsulas, 15 times - Kamchatka and Asia Minor. But the famous, important and attractive Crimea was largely due to the peculiarities of his nature, and, above all, the peculiar geographical position.</p>
<p>The Crimean peninsula is located in the south of the East European Plain at approximately the same distance from the equator and the North Pole (within 44023I 46019I and latitude, 32030I 36040I and east). Extreme northern point of the Crimean peninsula (Rekopsky isthmus) is deleted from the extreme south (Cape Sarich) at 207 km, and the western (Cape Kara Mrun on Tarkhankut Peninsula) from east (Cape Lantern on the Kerch Peninsula) - 324 km.</p>
<p>Crimea is the only region of Ukraine with the prevailing sea borders. Diamond shaped array of Crimea with a tapered Tarkhankut peninsula in the west and the narrow Kerch Peninsula in the east cuts deeply into the waters of the Azov-Black Sea basin. The coastline stretches for more than 1000 km. Black Sea washes the peninsula to the west and south, forming a series of bays (Karkinitsky, Calamita et al.) And coves, the most convenient are Sevastopol and Balaklava. Shallow Sea of ​​Azov and its bay Siwash wash the Crimea in the east and northeast. On the mainland the Crimean peninsula connected narrow and short semikilometrovym Perekopsk isthmus. The beauty of the peninsula and the features of its shape allowed the famous Chilean poet Pablo Neruda called it "the most magnificent medal on the chest of the Earth."</p>
<p>Rekopsky isthmus is too narrow for the Crimea sufficient links with the territory adjacent regions of Ukraine, especially as it passes through a series of natural boundaries of different levels (tectonic, hydrologic, floral, phenological et al.) That impair its function as a liaison with mainland.</p>
<p>Among the more or less large peninsulas world Crimean peninsula differs smallest ratio of width to length of the isthmus coastline of less than 0.007 (For comparison the same ratio in the following peninsulas: Iberian - 0.12 Apennine - 0.13, Malacca - 0 02 Korean - 0.18, Kamchatka - 0.03, California - 0.06).</p>
<p>The distribution of many natural components of the characteristic manifestations of island traits. Thus, the typical circular (tsirkumostrovnoe) distribution of climatic events: the central part of the peninsula differ from coastal - on the coast of less rainfall, long duration of sunshine, breezes blow.</p>
<p>Varied and the surface of the Crimean Peninsula: vast flat plains alternating with dissected hills that give way to the south of the mountains, steeply to the sea. Because of the latitudinal location of the Crimean Mountains (highest point - Roman-Kosh (1545 m) within a relatively small peninsula, there is a sharp contrast between the climate: from steppes in temperate geographical zones in the plains to the sub-Mediterranean (with subtropical elements) on the south shore .</p>
<p>What plains bordering mountains and mountain ranges - the sea, makes the variety of landscapes, mosaic distribution. The level of landscape diversity Crimea higher than in any other territory of Ukraine. This creates a unique color of the Crimean nature. No wonder so attractive Crimea for filmmakers who are here are suitable for shooting landscapes in many regions of the world.</p>
