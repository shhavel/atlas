<p>This card can be used in the characterization of global challenges such as food, health problem, the problem of overcoming the backwardness of the developing countries.</p>
<p>Medical (physiological) norm calorie food consumed by man for a day, a 2 300-2 600 calories and 70-100 grams of protein. If a person does not receive the minimum amount of calories, he feels constant hunger and further physical and mental exhaustion. In the world, according to WHO, 1.2 billion people are starving. Another 2 billion people suffer from hidden hunger, malnutrition receiving, which lacks a sufficient amount of animal protein (meat, milk), essential vitamins and minerals. This phenomenon is especially characteristic of the countries where the diet is dominated by residents of one food crops (eg, rice, corn or potato). Map shows that the nutritional problems are citizens of developing countries. In developed countries, the daily intake of food is, on average, 3300 kcal, and there is a surplus of food. The population of the countries with a low level of economic development is not able to satisfy the need for good nutrition. With three times more population, these states possess up to six times less than the total GNP than advanced countries. Due to illness, starvation and malnutrition, lack of quality drinking water there is a low life expectancy and high mortality. Expenditure on health in developing countries are minimal, except for the NIS and the countries - exporters of oil.</p>
<p>One way to solve the food problem and overcoming hunger may be the Green Revolution, which began in some countries in the 60-ies famous twentieth century. It provides a set of measures for the implementation of high-yielding varieties of crops, breeding, irrigation, use of chemicals and mechanization of agricultural production. The effectiveness of the Green Revolution has been proven in the countries of Asia (India, Thailand, Indonesia, and China), as well as Mexico. These over-populated countries in recent decades have made impressive strides in ensuring food security.</p>
