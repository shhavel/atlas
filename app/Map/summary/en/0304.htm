<p>Zori</p>
<p>Dawn - cosmic body. Each star - a giant red-hot ball. The temperature at the surface is different. From the surface temperature depends on the color of the stars.</p>
<p>Dawn is a group called constellations. Even in ancient times people have given constellation names for their similarity to various subjects. For example, there is a constellation of Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Sagittarius, Pisces and others.</p>
<p>The stars seem tiny that are very far from Earth. The nearest star to Earth - the sun. The distance from Earth to the sun 150 million km. But to another nearest stars - in 270 thousand times farther.</p>
<p>The stars are different sizes. Sun - the star average. Its diameter - 1 million 392 thousand. Km. Other stars in billions of times larger than the sun or much less of it.</p>
<p>SOLAR SYSTEM</p>
<p>The temperature at the surface of the sun reaches 6 thousand. Degrees and deep - up to 15 million degrees. At such temperatures, all substances that make up the sun, while in the hot gas. Because the Sun constantly emits a lot of light and heat.</p>
<p>Sunlight and heat lit and warmed the planet moving around the sun.</p>
<p>Planets do not emit light and heat. This -holodni planetary bodies. their lights and heats the sun.</p>
<p>The planets seem bright stars. This is because they are lit by reflected sunlight.</p>
<p>The way in which the planet moves around the Sun, called the orbit.</p>
<p>Most planets have natural satellites - space body. They move around the planets in their orbits. Earth has one satellite - the Moon, Mars - 2 Jupiter - 16, and Saturn - 18 moons.</p>
<p>Moving around the Sun as asteroids, comets and meteors.</p>
<p>Sun and planetary bodies - planets and their natural satellites, asteroids, comets, meteors, moving around the sun - form the solar system.</p>
