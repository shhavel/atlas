<p>Climate</p>
<p>Because the equator crosses Africa, almost in the middle, in the northern and southern climatic zones, except for the equatorial, repeat. There are two subekvatorialnyh two tropical and two subtropical zones.</p>
<p>In the equatorial belt within a year characterized by warm and humid air masses, equatorial type of climate with high temperature (+ 26 ° C - + 28 ° C) and total rainfall over 2000 mm, distributed evenly throughout the year.</p>
<p>Sub-equatorial climate zones located around the equatorial belt and is also characterized by high temperature (25 ° C - + 28 ° C), but is clearly seen alternating summer wet and winter dry periods. This is due to the fact that summer is dominated by equatorial humid air masses, and in winter - dry tropical.</p>
<p>Tropics is the largest area on the mainland. During the year, is dominated by continental air masses - dry high, especially in summer temperatures. Under their influence in the Sahara and in South Africa formed tropical desert type climate.</p>
<p>The extreme north and south subtropical zones lie at an average annual temperature of about 20 ° C, which varies considerably by season. Depending on rainfall here identified two climatic region. On the north and south-west Africa region is dominated by a Mediterranean climate, rain is falling mainly in winter, summer - dry. In the south-east of the mainland due to the impact trade winds formed subtropical climate region with a uniform moisture.</p>
<p>Natural areas</p>
<p>Strike natural areas in Africa is due to the flat nature of topography, size and position of the continent. Because the southern part of Africa is much narrower and more mountainous north by here strike natural areas close to meridional. In the northern part of the same natural area extending mainly along the parallels.</p>
<p>Area humid equatorial forests formed on red-yellow feralitni soils under conditions of sufficient moisture. Plants reach a height of upper tier 80 meters. The second and third tiers are figs, different types of palm trees and plants with valuable solid wood. The lowest tier is represented by undemanding to light tree ferns, a variety of shrubs. It is also rich and fauna. Martyshko, baboons, chimpanzees, gorillas, birds, bats feel comfortable enough, spending most of his life in the trees. Ground layer captured elephants, rhinos, leopards, pythons. Frequently there mosquitoes, mosquitoes, ants.</p>
<p>In the area of ​​variable-humid forests dominated by trees that shed their leaves in the dry season.</p>
<p>Area savannas and woodlands - a vast expanse of grassland (grass - up to 5 m) with single trees (baobab and acacia) and shrubs. Because the grass cover does not have time to decompose by the dry season, the soil humus accumulates that paints it in a distinctive reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>For savannah characterized pronounced seasons: rainy and dry, this causes significant migration of animals over long distances in search of water and food. The fauna is very diverse savannah, here you can find thousands of antelopes, buffaloes, zebras, wandering in search of lush grass; near water - giraffes, rhinos, elephants, hippos. Many predators (lions, cheetahs, hyenas). Also savannas lot of birds that are often near water birds form huge colonies.</p>
<p>Desert and semi-desert zone formed mainly in tropical zones. Nayblshu area they occupy in North Africa due to the fact that the northern part of the continent is much broader than the south and is the least the influence of the oceans. Prevalence is dry and hot continental air masses with large changes in temperature throughout the day leads to rapid destruction of rocks and the formation of stones and sand. Consequently formed different types of deserts, rocky (most of the Sahara and Namib) and sand and clay.</p>
<p>Desert tropical soils are poorly developed and often saline, except in river valleys and places close to the surface suitable ground water - are growing rich vegetation of the ancient times people settle. These places are called oases (the largest - the valley of the Nile).</p>
<p>The fauna of the desert rather poor. And those animals that live here are adapted to life in extreme conditions. Yes, hyena, jackal, cheetah satisfied To the moisture that falls to them with food. Antelopes and gazelles have to deal with hundreds of miles in search of food.</p>
<p>Turtles, lizards, snakes escape from the heat in burrows, and go hunting for the most part, when the heat subsides. Quite often there are ostriches drohfy, larks.</p>
<p>Area tverdolystyh evergreen forests and shrubs are formed under conditions of the Mediterranean climate in the brown soil. The plants are well adapted to the dry summer. Flora is represented African species of oak and beech, wild olive, arbutus, dwarf palm tree.</p>
<p>In the mountains of Africa clearly seen high-altitude zone, forests give way to savanna, further up - meadows, and on the tops of the biggest mountain (even at the equator) are perennial snows.</p>
