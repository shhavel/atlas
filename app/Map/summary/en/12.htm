At the end of the XV - beginning of XVI century began development of the Donetsk steppe Cossacks. More intensive settlement of the land began in the XVII century. The leading role is played by the Cossacks and the development of land north of the Seversky Donets River, which became known as Sloboda Ukraine. In the first quarter of XVIII century. this work began with the use of coal.
