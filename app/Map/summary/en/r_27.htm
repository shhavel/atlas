<p>Climate</p>
<p>Geographical location of the continent makes the receipt of substantial amount of solar radiation throughout the year. South America - the wettest continent of the globe. Trade wind circulation and influence of the warm Brazilian and Guiana currents - the basic premise that the average annual rainfall on the continent about twice higher than in any other continent. However, the cold Peruvian current and the area of ​​high atmospheric pressure make of the west coast (Atacama Desert) most droughty area, not only in South America but also throughout the world. Significant influence on the climate of the continent is a relief. Andes - the longest mountain range on Earth - a barrier to the penetration of dry cool Pacific air masses. It formed alpine type climate. The plains to the east, on the contrary, allow almost unhindered from the Atlantic penetrate the warm and moist air masses inland.</p>
<p>In the always hot and humid equatorial belt falls western part of the Amazon basin and north-west coast of the Pacific Ocean. The climate is equatorial belt of North America shaped by the Atlantic humid air masses and high temperatures throughout the year.</p>
<p>For subekvatorialnyh zone characterized by hot, humid summers and dry, hot, and winters slight difference of summer and winter temperatures (lowland and Orinokska Guiana Plateau, eastern and southern part of the Amazon basin, part of the Brazilian Plateau).</p>
<p>The southeastern part of the Brazilian Plateau, the northern part of La Plata Lowlands are in the tropics and are characterized by contrasting seasons temperatures and large differences in rainfall in coastal and inland areas. Rain falls mainly in the summer, but much less than in subekvatorialnyh zones.</p>
<p>Subtropical zone characterized by significant differences of its various parts. From warm with uniform moisture in the east and dry continental inland areas to the Mediterranean climate of the Pacific coast with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Temperate zone of the continent shaped by Western transfer of air masses and is characterized by distinct seasons. Significant moisture (up to 3000 mm per year) formed the western part of the zone is temperate maritime climate type with little throughout the year temperatures and high rainfall. The eastern part of the belt is characterized by sharp fluctuations in temperature and low rainfall (moderate continental type of climate).</p>
<p>Natural areas</p>
<p>The wet equatorial forests in South America called Selva. This natural area formed on the Amazon basin, adjacent slopes of the Andes, and in the northern Pacific coast, and embraces a larger area than similar forests in Africa. Here, the red-yellow soils feralitni grow thousands of plant species. Trees form a twelve tiers, the largest of which is 80 meters high and 4 meters in diameter (Ceiba). The lower tier - real impenetrable thicket (Hevea, cocoa, melon tree ferns). In the backwaters of rivers rising Victoria Regia - water lily with leaves up to 2 m. The same rich and fauna (monkey, sloth, jaguar, anaconda, etc.). Particularly noteworthy hummingbird - the smallest bird on earth and piranha - only bloodthirsty fish. The local forests teeming with insects and spiders.</p>
<p>Area savaniridkolissya northern and southern parts of the continent differ. Savannas and woodlands Guiana highlands and lowlands Orinokska resemble African savanna with palm trees instead of baobab. Savannah in the south of the continent posushlyvishi because trees here - a rarity, but in red and red-brown soils dominated by shrubs, tree cacti and trees with barrel barrel. Peculiar here and fauna, unlike the African savannah, there are few ungulates. Tapirs, peccaries, puma, Murashkoyid with lots of ants and termites - typical inhabitants of these places.</p>
<p>To the south savannahs are moving into a zone of subtropical grassy steppes (pampas). Typical of these places have climates with large difference in precipitation from mild with a uniform moisture in the east it changes to a more arid with significant temperature fluctuations in the south and west zones. Considerable damage the local natural vegetation severely plowing and indiscriminate grazing. The animals in this zone there rhea ostrich, pampasnyy deer, guanacos, in many different places these rodents.</p>
<p>In the southern part of the continent is called Patagonia, formed semi ipustel area - the only place in the world where they enter the sea coast within the temperate zone. With the small amount of rainfall is rather poor living world: the sirozemnyh and brown soils growing grasses, cacti and shrubs cushion. The fauna is represented mainly reptiles and rodents, although there puma, llama, rhea ostrich. Coastal deserts and semi-deserts stretch and narrow strip on the west coast of the continent. Driest part of the natural area - Atacama Desert - the most droughty place on the planet. The prevailing air masses, and chilled Peruvian air flow not form rain clouds. So it happens that the rain does not fall here in 10-20 years.</p>
<p>Due to the high altitude in the Andes developed high-altitude zone from humid equatorial forests (Gilea) on the foot of the mountains in the equatorial belt to hirskyhlukiv on the highlands. Above 5000 meters the snow never melts and turns into ice.</p>
