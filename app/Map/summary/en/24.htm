<p>Iron and steel - one of the basic industries of many countries. The production process in the steel industry consists of a number of successive productions. The initial stage is the extraction of iron and manganese ore, coking coal and non-metallic minerals. Then follows the enrichment of ores and the production of coke, pig iron and steel, manufacturing and rolled alloys. Iron and steel material-industry (to produce one ton of steel is used more than 6 tons of raw materials, fuel and auxiliary materials). Therefore, the steel industry disposes near iron ore and coal basins. Thus arose the metallurgical areas of Russia (Ural, Kuznetsk), Ukraine (Donetsk, Pridneprovsky), Germany (Ruhr), Poland (Upper Silesia), United States (Pennsylvania), China, India.</p>
<p>Modern production of ferrous metals is focused on the consumer and the traffic flows of raw materials, ie, Located near the main markets or major transportation hubs. It is so arranged smelters in Japan, South Korea, Italy, the new factories in Germany, France, USA, Russia.</p>
<p>The largest producers of ferrous metals are China, the US, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Ukraine, India. The highest rates of steelmaking per capita in the European countries (Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Ukraine) and in Japan.</p>
<p>For small European countries are characterized by the creation of specialized mini-mills that produce high-quality steel and rolling complex, as well as enterprises in the processing industry (using scrap).</p>
