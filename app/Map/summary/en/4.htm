<p>Ukrainian Revolution witnessed an inextinguishable desire to create their own Ukrainian state. In 1917 the Ukrainian people has received a historic chance to free themselves from foreign dependence and create their own unified democratic state.</p>
<p>Participants and researchers Revolution indicate its reasons are:</p>
<p>Dependent and oppressed state of Ukraine, velykoderzhavnytska policy on her ruling circles of both Russia and Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p>The difficult social situation of the majority of the population. Unresolved agrarian question and social security workers.</p>
<p>The rise of Ukrainian national liberation movement, organizational and ideological its design.</p>
<p>The immediate impetus for the revolution was the First World War, which has exacerbated the problem of warring states, weakened and led to the collapse of the Russian and later Austro-Hungarian empires. This gave a historic chance Ukrainian people in the struggle for statehood.</p>
<p>March 8 (February 23, Old Style), 1917 in the Russian Empire, its capital, Petrograd, the revolution broke out. People, desperate poverty and a failed war, stood up to fight against their abusers. Tsar Nicholas II, unable to curb the uprising, 15 (2) March 1917 abdicated. The tsarist regime, which for centuries oppressed nations scattered in a few days.</p>
<p>The overthrow of the tsarist put on the agenda the question of the fate of the country and the government. Society was divided into supporters of different, sometimes opposite, views on this issue. One part of society, headed by the newly established Provisional Government adhered to the idea of ​​freedom of private property, entrepreneurship and democracy. That is, the values ​​that underpin European civilization. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary, in their opinion, victoriously conclude the First World War. However, their views are not shared by the majority of peasants and workers that rallied around created the Soviets of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies. They argued that the proposed Interim Government measures are not sufficient and it is necessary to ensure a normal life for most of the population to stop, finally, a war to give land to the peasants, to create an effective social protection system and guarantees the rights and freedoms. The most radical figures (Bolshevik Party) did call for the abolition of private property and the establishment of equality and justice, that the introduction of socialist (communist) social order. Confrontation between supporters of different political views led to a sharp struggle that led to the Civil War.</p>
<p>Whirlwind Revolution captured and Ukraine.</p>
<p>To defend their rights Ukrainian needed a guiding center. Through the efforts of Ukrainian leaders Kyiv was established Ukrainian Central Rada. At first it was one of Kiev's organizations that emerged in the city during the revolution. Chairman of the Rada was elected the most authoritative figure of the Ukrainian movement, historian Michael Hrushevskoho. Election day management of the UCR 20 (7) March 1917 is the date of its establishment.</p>
<p>Very quickly UCR won the trust of the population. Evidence of this was the demonstration by thousands of Ukrainian yellow-blue flags in St. Petersburg and Kiev, and later other cities.</p>
<p>Inspired local support, UCR figures set about developing a program of action and claims Ukrainian, as well as organizing the movement. To this end, in early April was called Ukrainian National Congress. In it brought together about 1,500 delegates from all over Ukraine. The Congress adopted a policy of strongly demands national-territorial autonomy within the Federal Ukraine and democratic Russia, provided that the rights of all the peoples who live in Ukraine, and the same rights of the Ukrainian minority in Russia.</p>
<p>UCR from Kiev organization turned into an all.</p>
<p>Congress and its decision contributed to the further deployment of the Ukrainian movement, which began embrace all new segments of society: peasants, workers and especially the military (during the war with the Russian army was mobilized 3.5 million Ukrainian) that are delegated to the UCR representatives. As a result, the UCR increased numerically with the National Center turned into a Ukrainian representative body - the parliament.</p>
<p>The next step UCR began negotiations with the Provisional Government. The essence of the requirements of the Ukrainian delegation was to ensure that the Russian government has recognized the autonomy of Ukraine and defined its borders. But in Petrograd ukrantsyam refused. Then the Ukrainian leaders have embarked on the practical implementation of the idea of ​​autonomy Ukraine without approval from the Russians.</p>
<p>June 10, 1917 at the Second All-Ukrainian Military Congress V. Vynnycenko read the text and wagon UCR, which proclaimed: "Do not oddilyayuchys from all over Russia, not breaking with the State Russian, Ukrainian let people in my country has a right to their lives poryadkuvaty . Let the order and harmony in country to provide selected vselyudnym, equal and direct suffrage and Tyne Nationwide Ukrainian charges (Soim). All the laws that should give the system here in this country, in country, have the right to publish only our Ukrainian charges. "</p>
<p>Publishing and Universal sparked enthusiasm in Ukrainian society. UCR has reached the highest point of his popularity.</p>
<p>The confirmation of the seriousness of UCR, was the creation of the General Secretariat - Ukrainian government headed by V. Vynnycenko.</p>
<p>Alarmed by this development, the Provisional Government conceded. Between Petrograd and Kyiv have signed an agreement that was designed as a Universal II. Yes, UCR postponed implementation of the idea of ​​autonomy declaration of Ukraine to the Russian Constituent Assembly, and that the General Secretariat undertook to recognize a public authority in five Ukrainian provinces: Kiev, Poltava, Chernihiv, Podolia and Volyn.</p>
<p>In the development of the Ukrainian Revolution and activities UCR is a moment when people needed to show their ability to manage and solve practical problems. But before that Ukrainian leaders were not ready. The rapidly falling living standards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the raging revolution Russia could become a normal life. Various political movements by force attempted to seize power. In early November (late October) in 1917, the Bolsheviks did revolt against the Provisional Government and overthrew him. UCR appeared before a choice: support the supporters of the defeated Russian government to recognize the power of the Bolsheviks or declare independence Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>Accelerated resolution of the Bolsheviks themselves, trying to seize power in Kiev. Nov. 10 (October 29) in 1917 began fighting in the city between the Bolsheviks and supporters TU. Using this, troops loyal to the UCR, forced the warring parties to end the fighting and established their control over the city. In this situation, 22 (7) November 1917 UCR issued its Universal III. It stated: "From now Ukraine is the Ukrainian National Republic. Without separating from the Russian Republic and preserving its unity, we stand firmly on the earth that the entire Russian Federation Republic became free and equal nations. Ukraine to the Constituent Assembly, the whole power of creating order in our land, and give laws to govern belongs to us, the Ukrainian Central Rada, and our Government - General Secretariat of Ukraine. "</p>
<p>In addition, Universal III proclaimed a broad program of reforms that would have to change lives for the better Ukrainian.</p>
<p>In Universal housed and promise to immediately begin peace talks on Ukraine's withdrawal from the First World War. 11 (24) December 1917 the General Secretariat appealed to all belligerents and neutral states of the note, which stated that the UPR would make international relations on their own. Ukrainian delegation joined the peace talks, which started Soviet Russia with the Quadruple Alliance at Brest-Litovsk. On the eve of the departure of the delegation, headed by V. Golubovych (later Alexander Sevryuk), its detail instructed M.Grushevskiy.</p>
<p>The delegation was to seek the inclusion of the UPR Eastern Galicia, Bukovina, Transcarpathia, Holm, Podlasie, and in case of failure - the formation of these lands in the Austro-Hungarian Empire separate crown land with extensive rights of autonomy.</p>
<p>Negotiations started on December 28, 1917 (January 10, 1918).</p>
