<p>The consequences of the Earth's rotation on its axis is the change of day and night, the shape of the planet and the deviation bodies (moving horizontally) in the northern hemisphere - right in the South - to the left.</p>
<p>Complete rotation on its axis, our planet does 24 hours (day). So an hour all points of the Earth (except the poles) are returned to 15 °. Given this fact, the planet is divided into 24 time zones, where the numbering is from west to east - from zero zone 23 th. Because of the uneven illumination of the globe at every meridian at the same time of the day varies, it is called sonyachnymabo local time. In fact, for the convenience of using standard time - local time of the central meridian of each zone. Local time Ґrynvitskoho meridian taken as worldwide.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the map, the boundaries of time zones is often not identical with the meridians, in fact they are on the boundaries and limits of political subdivisions. This is done for convenience. For example, the length of the Ukraine in terms of degree - 18 ° 05 '(with a width of one time zone 15 °), therefore, our country would have to be in three time zones, but in fact, Ukraine is in one zone.</p>
<p>Because of the Earth's rotation on its axis the planet, an imaginary line that separates the places in the same time with calendar dates with a difference of one day. This line is preferably 180 th meridian is called liniyeyuzminy dates.</p>
