<p>Banks of Ukraine the Black Sea and Azov Sea. The Black Sea area 422 thousand. Km2. Most of it is located in the subtropical zone. The average depth - 1271 m, maximum - 2245 m. At depths greater than 100-120 m of water saturated with hydrogen sulfide, which has a negative impact on organic life. In the Black Sea include more than 660 species of plants and 2,000 species of animals that live predominantly in aerobic (oxygen-rich) zone. Each year the sea gives up to 300 thous. Tons of biological resources. The environmental problems of the Black Sea:</p>
<ul>
<li>excessive flow of industrial, domestic and agricultural pollution, which leads to accumulation of dead organic matter and increased content of hydrogen sulfide;</li>
<li>reduction of free oxygen in sea water, making water blooms, dying fish, shellfish, algae in estuaries;</li>
<li>decrease in the catch of the Black Sea mullet, mackerel, horse mackerel, resulting in economic losses;</li>
<li>catastrophic breeding jellyfish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The area of ​​the Sea of ​​Azov - 39 thousand sq. Km2. It is located in the temperate zone. The average depth of 4-7 m, maximum - 15. Flora and fauna of high-performance, in particular, there are 79 species of fish. Problems Azov associated with human activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase in salinity due to reduction of streamflow major rivers (the construction of reservoirs, increase water intake for household needs);</li>
<li>reduction of water;</li>
<li>reduction in biological productivity.</li>
</ul>
