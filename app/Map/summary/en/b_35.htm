<p>The world economy as a single system of interconnected national economy emerges from the international geographical division of labor (MHPP). MHPP - a specialization of individual countries in the production of certain products and services, and exchange them. Intergovernmental relations in the economic sphere called international economic relations. The main forms of international economic relations are: foreign trade, credit and financial relations, scientific and technical relations, international tourism. On this map provides information on foreign trade, credit and financial relations.</p>
<p>Formation and development of international economic relations began to trade. Foreign trade is constantly growing, changing structure of trade, especially in rapidly growing share of new technologies, products and services. In the world there were three centers of international trade: Europe, Asia Pacific and North America. Turnover in Western Europe is about 40% of the world. In absolute volume of exports to the world top ranked Germany. The second region is Asia by turnover (approximately 26%). In it the main centers of international trade are the Japan, China and newly industrialized countries (NICs) and the oil producing Gulf states. In third place in terms of foreign trade in North America (20% of world trade). In terms of US imports have no competition. Of great importance is the trade between developed countries and developing countries. Status commodity applications to industrialized countries still inherent in most developing countries. They still remain the main suppliers of oil, copper, cotton, natural rubber and food products: coffee, cocoa, sugar, bananas and more. But the exports NEC Asia and Latin America in recent years has increased the share of manufactured goods.</p>
<p>An important indicator of foreign trade is the trade balance (balance) - the difference between the value of exported and imported goods worth per year. The balance is passive (negative) and active (positive). Traditionally high surplus (the value of exports dominates the cost of imports) with Japan and Germany. The negative balance in the US is the result of large imports of raw materials and fuel from developing countries.</p>
<p>International trade is developing according to objective economic laws and is coordinated by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This organization brings together 145 countries. Its main function is to create a strong and prosperous trading system in the world, which will increase the volume of international trade.</p>
<p>Credit and financial relations are manifested in the export (export of capital) in two forms: loans and loans and direct investment in the establishment of enterprises on foreign territory or acquisition of existing companies for the purpose of profit or pleasure political interests. Exports of capital - one of the most important features of foreign economic activity in developed countries. The main form of export of capital is private equity, ie those which give the investor the right to control the activities of a particular object. The bulk of these investments provide the largest transnational companies (TNCs) in the world: Nestle (Switzerland), GeneralMotors (USA), Royal-Dutch-Shell (UK-Netherlands), Hitachi (Japan), Daimler-Chrysler (Germany - USA) and others . Developed countries have actively exporting capital to developing countries, there perebazovuyuchy environmentally harmful production, using low-paid labor, exploiting the natural resources of these countries. In addition to investing in the economy of a developing country, the developed countries are investing heavily in its developed economy partners that are less risky, but less lucrative. So part of the Japanese capital aimed at the US and Western Europe. EU countries invest their capital both within the Union and the regions in transition. Investments are shown on the map.</p>
<p>Also, the map shows the main banking and financial centers of the world, which are components of national and international banks (international banking consortia), stock and commodity - Raw. In a world of two types of international financial centers: one emerged on the basis of national capital markets (London, Paris, Zurich), others - on the basis of international capital markets (Singapore, Syan“ëan).</p>
<p>Important components of the world economy is an offshore zones - areas or individual countries in which a preferential tax, credit and currency regulation and created conditions for simplified business registration in order to ensure the most favorable conditions for foreign capital. Now more than 100 countries and territories with offshore centers. However, in industrialized countries, this practice is not widespread. Analogues of offshore zones in Ukraine are special economic zones and territories of priority development.</p>
