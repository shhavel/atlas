<p> The global economic crisis of 1929-1933. Sharpened international relations and caused the threat of a new war. Unlike in 1914, 30 years little states wanted to fight. This situation made a real opportunity to avoid war under conditions of joint action svtovoho community. But that did not happen.</p>
<p>First there was the fire of war in the Far East. In the autumn of 1931, Japanese troops occupied the territory of Manchuria - an important strategic and economic sense of China.</p>
<p>But Japan has not been condemned as an aggressor. League of Nations just announced that Manchuria is an integral part of China and does not recognize the newly formed state Manchukuo Go on its territory. In response to Japan in 1933. Ostentatiously withdrew from the League of Nations. There are in this case sanctions against Japan were not introduced. Appeared first precedent of impunity for aggression.</p>
<p>In 1935 it took advantage of precedent Italy. She considered herself deprived the First World War, so do not hide aggressive plans, which included the conquest of Ethiopia and intentions. In the 1935-1936 biennium. Italian army invaded this African country.</p>
<p>After Hitler came to power, Germany joined the group of excited states. By 1933 the situation in Germany within the Versailles system was much easier. She stopped paying reparations. The negotiations on disarmament in 1932 it promised equality of arms. At the official level even discussed the return of German colonies. An important step in the further elimination of Versailles was signed in July 1933 at the suggestion of Mussolini "Covenant consent and cooperation" between Britain, France, Italy and Germany. This pact provided extensive cooperation of States on revision of Versailles and legally establishes the equality of the German armaments. However, ratification of the treaty failed. For Hitler renegotiation of the Treaty of Versailles was only the first step towards world domination. The next step was to be the union of all Germans in one state, and it is envisaged accession of Austria, the Germans populated areas of France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Lithuania. The third step was to be the conquest of "living space" in the East. Seizing raw materials and agricultural resources of Eastern Europe, Germany, according to Hitler, will win the struggle for world domination.</p>
<p>Thus, each of the identified steps meant Hitler is not just a revision of Versailles, and the way to its complete elimination and radical change in international relations that exist. This was way before the war.</p>
<p>Evidence of Hitler's determination to become out of Germany from the League of Nations in October 1933</p>
<p>In 1934 an attempt was made to connect Austria. This has become an obstacle to Italy that threatened direct military intervention. Hitler retreated.</p>
<p>1935 was a turning point. After the payment of compensation for the French coal mines in the Saarland plebiscite result was ceded to Germany. And, in turn, refused to articles of the Versailles Treaty, which forbade her to have military aircraft, announced the introduction of universal conscription and the formation of an army of 36 divisions.</p>
<p>Between Britain and Germany concluded a naval agreement. Under this agreement allowed Germany to increase the tonnage of the fleet at 5.5 times and build submarines. Thus the German fleet had become larger than the French. Bilateral agreement was a violation of Versailles.</p>
<p>This turn of events was to disturb the nearest neighbors of Germany. European diplomacy has been actively discussing the idea of ​​a collective security system. In 1934 the Soviet Union was admitted to the League of Nations. In May 1935 the Soviet Union and France signed an agreement on mutual assistance. A similar agreement was signed between the USSR and Czechoslovakia. By agreement, the parties were obliged to provide mutual assistance. However, the ratification of this treaty France postponed by using the fact of signing the contract, as a means of pressure on Germany. Realizing this, Hitler dared to decisive action in March 1936, German troops were introduced into the Rhineland demilitarized zone. Neither Britain nor France would not have applied in this case stipulated measures. And in Germany was preparing to open war.</p>
<p>Thus, established after World War imperfect system of European security ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Common interests in Japan, Italy and Germany have led them to converge. November 25, 1936 Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, and November 6, 1937 Italy joined him. Formed an "axis" Berlin-Rome-Tokyo. The parties undertook to inform each other about the activities of the Comintern and conduct joint struggle against it. In addition to the contract promised in case of war one of the sides of the USSR did not do anything that could alleviate the situation of the USSR.</p>
<p>Germany recognized the conquest of Ethiopia by Italy. In 1936 Germany and Italy supported the fascist revolt in Spain, giving Gen. F.Franko direct and indirect assistance by ensuring victory in the Civil War (1936-1939.).</p>
<p>It is more difficult to develop relations of Germany and Japan. Both countries were far from each other and wanted to preserve freedom of action in their field of interest.</p>
<p>In those conditions, the preservation of peace meant Versailles-Washington system that, despite its shortcomings, ensuring relative stability and recognized the rule of law. This system included the principle of prevention of international crises, providing for collective action against an aggressor through the League of Nations. However, collective rebuff did not work, the mechanism did not work.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the ability of Western countries to act together against the aggressor fell through the aggravation of mutual rivalry in the search for solutions to the economic crisis. In addition, the difficult economic situation and distract public attention on the domestic issues. Solving them was a priority. Also in the West continued hostile to the USSR and Hitler's anti-Soviet attacks were seen in political circles as positive.</p>
<p>Collective resistance to the aggressors needed use of a variety, including power methods. Protecting the world in those circumstances demanded courage, will and readiness for certain losses. However, the very thought of it for people who have just survived the war, seemed out of place. The public in England and France was set firmly against the use of force. China, Ethiopia seemed too distant to see in them a threat to European security. Understanding the integrity and indivisibility of the world was not peculiar to the then social consciousness. Such sentiments are reflected in the policy of "appeasement", which led the country to inactivity and excessive caution.</p>
<p>Hitler's rise to power was immediately perceived as symbolic politics in Germany. For a long time it saw a strong national leader who seeks to restore justice in Germany. Nazi plans for division of the world first evaluated as a tribute to nationalist rhetoric and not taken seriously. The leaders of Britain and France saw no reason to change policy, which is actively implemented in the 20's and was aimed at the gradual easing of the burden of Versailles. It becomes clear lack of response of Britain and France in action in Germany, although they were openly insolent nature and violated one of the principles of international law, the contract must satisfy.</p>
<p>Nazism in Germany have not had time to show his predatory face. European countries have not experienced the horrors of occupation. Hitler seemed politician with whom you agree.</p>
<p>Special mention should be the position of the United States. The crisis there drew public attention to domestic issues. The increase in tension in the world gave rise to the US desire to dissociate itself from everything in his "American fortress." Following the adoption in 1935 of the law of neutrality richest country in the world, with significant resources and ability to influence world politics, as if dropped from it. This greatly increased the chances of aggressors.</p>
<p>Anti-Communist rhetoric of Hitler and his aggressive plans pushed the Soviet Union to speak for a collective security system and deter aggressors. Explorer of the course became the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the USSR M.Lytvynov. The USSR was able to consolidate its position. In 1933 established diplomatic relations with the US, and in 1934 the Soviet Union was admitted to the League of Nations as a member of the Council, which meant recognition of his great power.</p>
<p>Progress towards a collective security system was making in the 1935 Franco-Soviet treaty of mutual assistance. True, there were no military article, but in any case, the agreement opens the way for joint struggle against the aggressor. A similar agreement in 1935 was awarded to Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>The attitude of the West to create a system of collective security was cool. Soviet-French treaty was ratified by France only a year. Doubts caused primarily that the Soviet Union has no common border with Germany and to perform its obligations, the Soviet troops would have to cross the territory of Poland and Romania. And these states feared the Soviet Union over Germany, and categorically refused to pass the Soviets. In French the impression that the Soviet Union wants to drag France into conflict with Germany, but most stay away. When the West became known effects of repression in the Soviet Army, the military alliance with the USSR was regarded as unimportant.</p>
<p>The most active supporter of the policy of "appeasement" was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1937-1940 gg.) N. Chamberlain. In his view, the danger was not in Germany's aggressive intentions, and the underestimation of the international crisis. He believed that the First World War started because the great powers temporarily lost control of events resulting in local conflict escalated into a world war. To avert this danger, you want to keep contact with all participants of international conflict and resolve existing problems through mutual concessions.</p>
<p>In fact, Hitler advocated increasingly nahabnishi claim. They became the subject of discussion and all ended happy territorial claims in Germany.</p>
<p>The culmination of the policy of "appeasement" was the "Anschluss" of Austria and the Munich agreement concerning Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Accession of Austria was one of the most important policy objectives in Germany. In February 1938 the Chancellor of Austria with Germany Shushniґ signed an agreement that put Austria under the control of Germany. March 12, 1938, German troops with the support of the Austrian Nazis occupied Austria. No major powers nor the League of Nations did not react to it. Only the Soviet Union protested.</p>
<p>Another victim of Nazi aggression became Czechoslovakia, from which Germany demanded the Sudetenland, where the population of 3 million Germans. But at first the balance of forces was not in favor of Germany. Czechoslovakia was well armed and trained an army of 45 divisions and border fortifications. Germany had 47 divisions insufficiently armed. Moreover, the Soviet government proposed to Czechoslovakia under the contract of 1935 full assistance.</p>
<p>An international crisis. For its solution twice Chamberlain met with Hitler. They agreed that the conflict will be resolved in Munich.</p>
<p>During the Munich meeting, Hitler declared that the Sudetenland - the last territorial demand of Germany in Europe. This, and the Anglo-French ultimatum to the Czech-Slovak government to immediately transfer German areas of Czechoslovakia inhabited by Germans, cleared the way to the Munich Agreement. It was concluded behind Czechoslovakia prime ministers of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, 29-30 September 1938</p>
<p>An impact was exclusion from Czechoslovakia for Germany all the border areas. Czechoslovakia lost 20% of the population and almost 50% of heavy industry. The border with Germany began to pass, 40 km from Prague.</p>
<p>Munich agreement obliged Czechoslovakia to meet the claims of Poland and Hungary. Poland Cieszyn Silesia was transferred, Hungary - part of Slovakia and Carpatho-Ukraine. Czechoslovakia has become a federal state.</p>
<p>Munich agreement - one of the most shameful pages of Western diplomacy. Britain and France betrayed Czechoslovakia, a country, it may affect was associated with Versailles, one of the few real democracies in Europe. Was cynical reference to the right of nations to self-determination, the right of Germans, Hungarians, Poles unite with their motherland, as in 1919 in Paris, this right was sacrificed strategic anti-German and anti Hungarian interests, as in 1938 sacrificed policy of "appeasement."</p>
<p>Munich agreement meant the transformation of Germany into the strongest state in Central Europe. All small states in the region have realized that neither the League of Nations nor the United Kingdom and France can not guarantee their sovereignty and went to the rapprochement with Germany. In this sense, the Munich agreement was a strategic defeat in London and Paris, bringing the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>But while in the West the results were perceived collusion with relief. Chamberlain said he returned to London he had brought peace to this generation.</p>
<p>These thoughts dominated for long. For winter 1938/1939 biennium. Leaders of Britain and France realized the fallacy of his argument. Meanwhile, Hitler did not leave time for reflection. March 15, 1939, German troops occupied Bohemia and Moravia, Slovakia was declared an independent, while Hungary captured the entire Carpathian Ukraine.</p>
<p>In addition, Britain and France recognized F.Franko government in Spain, which opened the way for him to victory in the Civil War.</p>
<p>Then Germany began to seek from Poland consent to transfer her Dantsyґa and construction through the Polish Corridor extraterritorial highway that would Germany combined with Prussia. German troops entered the Memelsku area (Klaipeda), which belonged to Lithuania. In April 1939 Italy invaded Albania.</p>
<p>The collapse of the policy of "appeasement" became apparent. In the public mind there was a break. Governments are required hardness and determination in relation to Germany. Britain and France exchanged notes on mutual assistance in case of aggression and provided appropriate guarantees that States which have a common border with Germany. Began preparations for war.</p>
<p>The emergence of imminent threat of war demanded the government of Great Britain and France closer to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Munich fully demonstrated the impossibility of the Soviet leadership to create a system of collective security. Soviet-French and Soviet-Czechoslovak treaties were simply a piece of paper. For the Munich Soviet leadership was a signal that it wants to exclude from participation in European politics.</p>
<p>Soon France and Germany signed an agreement precious pact. USSR regarded this as an attempt to direct aggression West Germany to East.</p>
<p>The defeat of the Soviet Union in the European diplomatic front was held against the backdrop of deteriorating relations with Japan, which resulted in a conflict near Lake Khasan in July 1938 According to the Soviet leadership, the Soviet Union was faced with the prospect of aggression from the East and the West.</p>
<p>Caught in political isolation and proynyavshys distrust of Britain and France, the Soviet leadership began to seek ways of rapprochement with Germany. An important feature of Soviet foreign policy orientation change was to replace the post of Commissar Litvinov Foreign Affairs. New Commissar Molotov was, which meant that Stalin personally taken over management of foreign policy.</p>
<p>The turning point in Soviet foreign policy coincided with the start of revision policy in the West. USSR moved from England and France to Germany, and they sought a rapprochement with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>London and Paris are concerned about unforeseen developments, issued a statement guarantees assist a number of European countries - Poland, Romania, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Guarantees caused changes in the situation in Europe. Germany could not carry out aggression against the Soviet Union, without violating the sovereignty of Poland and Romania, and is therefore not risking find themselves at war with Britain and France.</p>
<p>In March 1939 the UK has offered the USSR to sign together with France and Poland Universal Declaration of interaction. In April 1939 the Western powers turned to the Soviet Union with a proposal to guarantee Poland and Romania.</p>
<p>In response, the Soviet Union proposed a pact of mutual assistance between Britain, France and the Soviet Union while providing guarantees to all states bordering the Soviet Union. However, negotiations started in this business, were difficult because of mutual mistrust between the parties and the reluctance of both sides to compromise. Parties failed to overcome differences in the case of indirect aggression. Britain and France saw the Soviet threat to the sovereignty formulation neighboring states. After any change in the border states of the Soviet Union to the Soviet leadership regarded as aggression, which gave him the opportunity to enter their territory war. Besides England considered these negotiations as a means of pressure on Germany and did not want to deal.</p>
<p>Along with political negotiations Britain, France and the Soviet Union agreed to launch negotiations for the conclusion of military missions Joint Convention. They also proved ineffective.</p>
<p>The formal obstacle to signing the convention was the reluctance of Poland and Romania pass through its territory to the Soviets. The Soviet leadership looked at the issue of rapprochement with Germany.</p>
<p>In August 1939 the Soviet Union was at the center of world politics. His commitment demanded as England and France, and Germany. The Soviet leadership grappled with the final choice of a benchmark that was supposed to be decisive for the course of events in the world.</p>
<p>According to Stalin's alliance with Britain and France, at best, could bring tensions with Germany and, at worst, a war with it. The Union also from Germany to the Soviet Union left side of world conflict. One would expect a cessation of hostilities with Japan Khalkhin Gol (there were from May to August 1939 in Mongolia), which could affect only Germany and the territorial gains at the expense of Poland, the Baltic States, Finland and Romania.</p>
<p>Germany was willing to accept it, just to bring the Soviet Union from the game, unleashing his hands for aggression against Poland, which was scheduled for August 26, and then on September 1st.</p>
<p>August 21, Stalin was Hitler a telegram in which he stated that he is committed to signing a nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union and is ready to sign any additional agreement that applies to all controversial issues. Hitler asked to accept the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to sign the corresponding documents.</p>
<p>On the same day, Stalin ordered to break off negotiations with Britain and France. He drove Hitler a telegram in which he expressed his hope for a significant turning point in Soviet-German relations, and agreed to accept the pact during this period.</p>
<p>After some negotiations, Ribbentrop and Molotov signed in the Kremlin, August 23, 1939 non-aggression pact and a secret protocol to it.</p>
<p>The protocol parties agreed on the delimitation of "spheres of interest" in Eastern Europe. Germany recognized the Soviet sphere of interest Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Becsarabiyu. Lithuania recognized area of ​​interest in Germany. The protocol called for the division of Poland, the line of which was held around the rivers Narew, Vistula, Sian.</p>
<p>By signing the protocol, the Soviet Union was actually across states - "incendiary war."</p>
<p>The immediate result of the signing of these documents was that the German troops in the morning September 1, 1939 attacked Poland. 3 September Britain and France declared war on Germany. The Second World War broke out.</p>
<p>The Spanish Civil War</p>
<p>In April 1931 the Spanish took bloodless revolution, which resulted in the monarchy was overthrown. But the delay of the new government in the reform more acute in the country. Bitter confrontation broke out between the left and right-wing political forces. In 1933 returned to power law and fully rolled out reforms. Basque refused to grant autonomy. Against opponents of the government used military force.</p>
<p>In 1934 the government began the policy of mass demonstrations population. Catalonia declared its independence in Asturias armed uprising broke out led by anarchists. Due to the lack of unity of the Left forces all these performances was suppressed.</p>
<p>Not resigned to the defeat, left in January 1936 formed the Popular Front, which gave a broad reform program. In February 1936 the Popular Front won the election.</p>
<p>Based on the army, right-wing forces have started to prepare a revolt. At the head of the conspirators were Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, General Sanhurno which is directly trained rebellion, and General Franco.</p>
<p>The revolt began July 17, 1936 in Spanish Morocco. The next day it spread to other parts of Spain. On the side of the rebels took over 80% of the composition of the Spanish Army (20 thousand. Officers on the side of the republic there are only 500), but the air force and navy remained loyal to the Republic. The country has a civil war. In the rebels once problem: Primo de Rivera was arrested and executed, Sanhurno died in a plane crash, Franco with the Moroccan forces had blocked the Republican fleet in Morocco. Mutiny threatened to defeat, but Franco came to the aid of Italy and Germany, on the aircraft overturned the Moroccan army in Spain.</p>
<p>Thus the internal conflict in Spain began to gain international znachennnya, becoming a fascist and anti-fascist opposition forces.</p>
<p>Franco, who in September 1936 led the rebels, proclaimed aim of the rebellion: to create "a totalitarian state, social peace and common prosperity."</p>
<p>The Republican government was hoping for assistance from Britain, France and the United States. But the leadership of these countries relied on international law, which prohibits interference in the internal affairs of other countries. They take into account their experience and in Russia, where armed intervention and support anti-Bolshevik forces had the opposite result.</p>
<p>27 countries signed an agreement of non-intervention in Spanish affairs. But Italy and Germany ignored this and actively supplying weapons Franco. In October 1936 the Soviet Union announced that it would not comply with the agreement, will send military advisers to the Republicans, supplying them weapons. In defense of the republic in the Spanish arrived variously estimated from 35 to 42 thousand. People who wanted to fight against fascism. Among them was formed the International Brigades.</p>
<p>In September 1936 formed a new republican government led by Largo Caballero. In the territory controlled by him had a very radical socio-economic reforms. Catalans and Basques have autonomy. But the political system gradually evolved towards a departure from democracy, the protection of which was the main objective of the war. This is partly explained by wartime; the main reason was the growing influence of communists who relied on the support of the USSR. Thus, the Spanish democracy ceased to exist before the Spanish Republic perished.</p>
<p>In 1936-1937. The main hostilities were around Madrid, but Franco offensives were repelled. It did not help them, "fifth column" (secret supporters of the rebels) in the capital. After an unsuccessful attempt to capture Madrid Franco Germany and Italy began openly intervened entering the country troops (German Legion "Condor", an Italian expeditionary force, the Portuguese army, etc., a total of about 200 thousand.). Trying Italians strike from north-west to the troops Republicans defending Madrid failed. In the town of Guadalajara in March 1937 Italianate building was destroyed.</p>
<p>After this defeat Franco focused major efforts in Catalonia, trying to take advantage of the conflict between the Trotskyites and the Communists. 3-6 May 1937 Trotskyites supported by Largo Caballero, made in Barcelona armed action to protest against the policies of the Communists. In April 1938 the army of Franco Catalonia cut off from the rest of the country. Trying to break the blockade Republican Army attack in July 1938 was not successful. In early 1939 the French troops occupied Catalonia. The territory controlled by Republicans, was cut off from France.</p>
<p>February 27, 1939 England and France broke diplomatic relations with the Republican government, and the government recognized Franco. Faced with international isolation (USSR almost stopped arms supplies, in 1938 Spain abandoned the International Brigades), March 6, 1939 in Madrid defense commander Colonel Casado overthrew the Republican government, and entered into negotiations with Franco. Attempt Communist uprising crushed. In the territory controlled by Republicans, joined Franco's troops. In Spain established the dictatorship of General Franco (March 1939 - November 1975).</p>
<p>The war cost to the Spaniards, killed 1 million 500 thousand. Left the country lying in ruins.</p>
