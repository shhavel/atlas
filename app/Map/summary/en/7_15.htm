<p><b>Basic concepts and terms</b></p>
<p>Doba fragmentation researchers call period in the history of Kievan Rus from the mid-12th to mid-13th century. Earlier Russian State strife and discord survived, remained centralized monarchy, from the mid-12th century. it began to manage association most powerful princes - princes of feudal principalities. Legalization Lyubech Congress patrimonial system developed so that princes increasingly feel better in their possessions by independent owners. Actually, to strengthen the independence of autonomous principalities and is the essence of fragmentation.</p>

<p><b>1. The causes disintegration of Kievan Rus</b></p>
<p>Historians explain the causes disintegration of Kievan Rus'.</p>
<p>Call between them</p>
<ul>
<li>of large size of the state,</li>
<li>diverse ethnic composition,</li>
<li>knyazivski usobytsi,</li>
<li>absence sustainable manner stolonasliduvannya,</li>
<li>Prairie kochovykiv attacks,</li>
<li>the decline of the trade route "from the Varangians to the Greeks".</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reason for most researchers consider the development of feudal tenure, strengthening its patrimonial forms.</p>
<p>Princes were not interested in big power of the Grand Duke of Kiev. Even more - they wanted for themselves the same authority.</p>
<p>Wonder in the 12th century. title "Grand Duke" along with Kyiv had Chernigov, Vladimir and some other princes.</p>
<p>Holders of autonomous principalities to guide their own internal politics, at its discretion, decide questions of war and peace, concluded agreements with neighbors.</p>
<p>Such autonomous principalities in the middle of the 12th century. was about 15, of which 5 were formed on Ukrainian territory, Kiev, Chernigov, Pereyaslavskoe, Volyn and Galician.</p>
<p>Comparison of crown land borders with territories tribal groupings East Slavic tribes that evolved during the settlement period (5-7 in.) Led scientists to believe that many weighed in the disintegration of Kievan Rus different ethnic composition of its territory.</p>
<p>Slowed down for a strong centralized government processes maturing three Slavic nations - Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian revived as soon as the power and waned and when favorable conditions in economic life.</p>
<p>On the soundness of this view is indicated by the fact that one of the first longer obey the Kyiv principality of Polotsk (Belarus), Novgorod and Vladimir-Suzdal (Russian territory).</p>
<p><b>Yet, despite the irreversible collapse and growing autonomy lands, principalities, Kievan Rus until the mid-13th century. was the only country - and the only area with common laws and only church.</b></p>
<p>Kyiv still remained, although increasingly formal, capital city, and for the right poknyazhyty it competed Rus' princes of the various principalities.</p>
<p>As during Monomakh, princes assembled at the Congress, where he addressed the controversial issues - mostly related to the organization of joint campaigns against the Polovtsian.</p>
<p>Each princes, barely won Kyiv table, tried to use his position to strengthen the authority of the Grand and restoration of centralized state.</p>
<p>Modern historians interpret fragmentation is not a collapse of the state, as a change in its structure and form of government. The disintegration of Kievan Rus researchers call a federal monarchy. Form of government characteristic of Kievan Rus era of fragmentation, defined as the collective suzerainty, instead of one power is exercised by the Grand Duke of association influential princes.</p>
<p><b>2. The principality of Kiev</b></p>
<p><b>Territory and resources</b></p>
<p>Mizhknyazivski sharpest controversy over 12 - in the first half of the 13th century. flashed by Kyiv table.</p>
<p>No wonder it was not, because Kyiv remained at the time one of the largest and richest cities in Europe.</p>
<p>It housed numerous courtyards boyars i kuptsiv, of large remisnychi maysterni.</p>
<p>In Kiev, lived about 50 thousand. Shower.</p>
<p>In Kiev remained rezydentsiya mytropolytiv.</p>
<p>Greatness answered capital city and the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Kiev principality was the most populated principality of Kievan Rus.</p>
<p>Chronicles called 80 cities i mistechok located here.</p>
<p>Source of wealth Kyiv lands were rodyuchi black and poliski Useful resources.</p>
<p>The network of rivers linked Kyiv land of Rus nayviddalenishymy corners and neighboring nations.</p>
<p><b>Competition for Kyiv</b></p>
<p>For solutions Lyubech Congress Kiev principality was recognized paternal Izyaslavich.</p>
<p>Having established in Kiev, Vladimir Monomakh was trying to turn Kyiv into a fiefdom Monomakh.</p>
<p>But all efforts were in vain: for the disintegration for the right to rule in Kiev fought with weapons princes of Chernigov, Volyn, Pereyaslav, Rostov-Suzdal, Smolensk ...</p>
<p>The rulers in Kyiv zastupaly each other 6-8 years or even more.</p>
<p>And none had a quiet reign, had to fend off claims of military applicants.</p>
<p>There were in Kiev and conspiracy, in which the active involvement of Kievan nobility.</p>
<p>Thus, the year 1146 after the death of Prince Vsevolod representative Chernigov branch of princes who ruled in Kiev from 1139, Kyiv table took Igor II of Kiev.</p>
<p>Boyars committed a conspiracy against him by inviting the city of Pereyaslav prince Iziaslav Mstislavovitch.</p>
<p>When he and his wife came to Kyiv, nobles openly went over to his side, and Igor Olgovich tonsured a monk.</p>
<p>By the way, Iziaslav Mstislavovitch reign was one of the most successful that stormy day.</p>
<p>It occurred against a background of almost continuous and largely victorious campaigns and battles on the rebellious princes and Polovtsian.</p>
<p>In addition, Prince Iziaslav tried to gain more independence to the Russian Orthodox Church, the year 1147 when the place was deserted Metropolitan, he insisted that on the position chosen Rusich - Climate Smolyatich.</p>
<p>Longest in the era of fragmentation continued reign in Kiev co Sviatoslav (1177-1194 gg.) And Rurik (1180-1202 gg.).</p>
<p>These princes belonged to two of the most influential families - Smolensk and Chernigov Olegoviches Rostislav.</p>
<p>Agreeing on sopravleniya, they ended the fierce quarrels mizhknyazivski that improved domestic situation.</p>
<p>Co-organized a joint campaign against the Russian princes Cuman and finally achieved that the nomads went to the lower reaches of the Seversky Donets River.</p>
<p>Under the successors of political authority co Kyiv steadily fading. Kiev land podribnylasya a considerable number of shares owned, and the latter Kyiv prince, whose reign was an era of fragmentation, learned of the approach of a powerful army of Mongols - the nomad conquerors, then under attack them Kievan Rus folded, fled from the city.</p>
<p><b>3. Chernihiv-Seversky Principality</b></p>
<p><b>Territory and major cities</b></p>
<p>This principality finally formed in the 11th century., By the will of Yaroslav the Wise, although Chernigovschiny land belonged to the oldest branch of the Russian state.</p>
<p>In the early 12th century. in Chernihiv principality covering the ground in pools left-bank of the Desna and Sejm, Sozh and upper Oka. From Kiev land Chernihiv separated Dnieper.</p>
<p>The second half of the 12th century. Chernigov prince ought Tmutarakan city - a major port in the Kerch Strait.</p>
<p>By day elaborated Chernigov principality was divided into smaller portions. The most influential among them was the principality of Novgorod-Seversky.</p>
<p>In Chernihiv Principality were many cities. The largest among them - Chernigov, Novgorod-Seversky, Putyvl, Bryansk, Kursk, Starodub - mentioned in the sources due to the many events Ruthenian history.</p>
<p>A capital city. Chernigov Kyiv inferior size only.</p>
<p>Chernihiv was well fortified and had good connections to other cities.</p>
<p>Chernihiv princes zealously cared about the development of the city.</p>
<p>Throughout the 12th century. was built in the famous Boris Cathedral - one of the best in Russia, St. Michael, Annunciation, Bloc, Assumption Church, each of which was worthy to be called the pearl of ancient architecture.</p>
<p><b>Chernihiv princes</b></p>
<p>Chernihiv land, under the will of Yaroslav the Wise, owned by Sviatoslav.</p>
<p>His sons Oleg and David became the founders of dynasties Chernigov princes - O. (Chronicle calls them Olegovichy) and Davidovich.</p>
<p>The representatives of these dynasties administer the fate of Chernigov lands.</p>
<p>Yes, from Chernigov Sviatoslav Yaroslav rulers did not leave dreams to win Kyiv.</p>
<p>The strength of the Chernigov principality evidenced by the fact that some of the princes indeed fortunate to rule in Kiev. This was, in particular, Vsevolod II of Kiev, who ruled in Kiev from 1139 to 1146</p>
<p>An interesting fact of political life Chernigovschiny hides some hostility with which the Kievan chroniclers announcing reign in Kiev Chernigov princes.</p>
<p>East Chernigov land directly bordering the world nomads.</p>
<p>Chernihiv princes, seeking peaceful relations, often resorted to dynastic marriages Polovtsian Princess.</p>
<p>Related nomads territorial, and sometimes hard, they eagerly attracted hordes of Polovtsian to exercise their vanity plans.</p>
<p>This policy did not find support in Kyiv residents, so often they stood, not wanting to admit Chernigov princes for her. Yet against the background of ancient history these events occurred infrequently. Many more references to the stubborn defense of the homeland Chernigov from nomadic attackers.</p>
<p><b>"Lay"</b></p>
<p>From Chernihivshchyna directly related event immortalized in her most important works of Ukrainian literature - the poem "Lay".</p>
<p>The main event was a member of the Novgorod-Seversky Prince Igor.</p>
<p>Year 1185 he was with the wife of his brother Vsevolod, son of Vladimir and nephew Svyatoslav went going to the Polovtsian.</p>
<p>Author of "Lay" so spoke about the purpose of the military operation: "I want to break or spears at Polovtsian field and to lay his head or helmet to drink water from the Don."</p>
<p>But one chivalrous enthusiasm was not enough. Igor Polovtsian was going to jump off guard.</p>
<p>However, from the beginning of the battle plan had to change because the nomads were ready to fight.</p>
<p>First day of the battle brought victory Russ. Polovtsi began retreating in the steppes.</p>
<p>Games rashly ordered to pursue them. So all night, the Russians were forced to the Polovtsian steppe.</p>
<p>This had tragic consequences. Polovtsi assembled a large force, and in the morning began to attack. The campaign ended in complete defeat - this shameful that such could not remember the n land: army almost all died, but the four princes were captured.</p>
<p>The effects of the campaign were so tragic that it opened the way Polovtsy Chernihiv, Pereyaslav and of the earth.</p>
<p>Relative calm on the southern borders of the Russian land, taken jointly by many princes, headed Kievan prince Svyatoslav and Rurik, was crossed.</p>
<p>The brilliant poet of the 12th century. took advantage of a failed campaign vain Novgorod-Seversky Prince Igor, to appeal to an appeal from Rus unity and warnings of evil that pushed him to the ground n mizhknyazivski strife and discord.</p>
<p><b>4. Pereyaslavskoe principality</b></p>
<p><b>Territory</b></p>
<p>Pereyaslavskoe principality formed by Yaroslav the Wise.</p>
<p>Its territory compared to other kingdoms was small.</p>
<p>To the east and south Pereyaslavshchyny land directly bordering the steppes.</p>
<p>Such geographical location largely determines the life Pereyaslavtsi, because their land served as a shield for the rest of Kyiv Rus and territories.</p>
<p>That is why in Pereyaslav principality measures Grand Prince of Kiev powerful defensive fortifications were constructed.</p>
<p>Mostly as a military fortress and the city appeared Pereyaslav.</p>
<p>Impregnable stronghold was, in particular, and Pereyaslav.</p>
<p>The city is located near the Dnieper River, where the river flows into the Alta Trubizh, and almost as reliable reinforcement that Kuman, which often vdyralys in Pereyaslavskaya land, the city and could not take it.</p>
<p><b>Features of political life</b></p>
<p>Immediate proximity to Kyiv and feature predetermined position Pereyaslav princes volodaryuyuchy Pereyaslav, as if they were expecting to have a good opportunity to gain Kyiv table.</p>
<p>Moving some of the princes from distant lands to Pereyaslav meant that a new powerful contender for Kyiv.</p>
<p>This fact explains why Pereyaslavskoe principality generally had no political independence and almost entirely dependent on Kyiv.</p>
<p>As for the princes of Pereyaslav, the prominent figures among them were many. Recall at least Vladimir Monomakh, who reigned in Pereyaslav 20 years.</p>
<p>During the rise of Pereyaslav principality fragmentation is associated in particular with Prince Vladimir Glebovich.</p>
<p>He was a constant participant of numerous antypolovetskyh campaigns, earned fame brave warrior and a gifted military leader.</p>
<p>As Novgorod-Seversky Prince Igor, Vladimir Glebovich immortalized by the author of "Words ...", but not for marnoslavnist and political nerozvazhlyvist, and as an organizer of Defense Pereyaslav.</p>
<p>Zeal with which to defend Vladimir Glebovich Pereyaslavskaya land of Polovtzy found sympathy and Kiev chronicler. By reporting during the year 1187 on the death of Pereyaslav prince, he noted, "for he loved his wife, and the gold is not collected, the property is not spared, and said to his wife; for it was Prince Valiant and all sorts of virtues was full. For him as much potuzhyla Ukraine. "</p>
<p><b>In the story of the death of Prince Volodymyr of Pereyaslav Glebovich during 1187 the chronicler used the name "Ukraine". This - the earliest mention of the name "Ukraine" in written sources.</b></p>
<p>After the death of Vladimir Glebovich Pereyaslav in princes no luck. They either did not exist and Pereyaslavshchyny obeyed Kyiv or ruled by those who did not leave a visible mark on history.</p>
