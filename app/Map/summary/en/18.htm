<p><b>The starry sky of the northern hemisphere</b></p>
<p>If you look into the night sky clear sky, we see many stars that twinkle like lights in the darkness. Dawn is a group called constellations. Even in ancient times people have given names of the constellations on their resemblance to various objects. For example, distinguish the constellation Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Sagittarius, Dragon Scales and more.</p>
<p>The stars seem tiny that are very far from Earth. In fact, any star - a red-hot ball of gigantic size. The temperature at the surface of stars varies and depends on the color of each star. The nearest star to Earth - the sun. The distance from Earth to the sun 150 million km. The remaining stars are much further away.</p>
<p><b>The Solar System</b></p>
<p>The temperature at the solar surface (nearest star) up to 6 thousand. Degrees and deep - up to 15 million degrees. At such temperatures, all substances that make up the sun, while in the hot gas. Because the Sun constantly emits a lot of light and heat, which warms and our planet.</p>
<p>The planet is - cold planetary bodies that do not emit light and heat, while their lights and heats the sun and they look bright, because reflecting sunlight.</p>
<p>Each planet moves around the Sun is not chaotic, but on its own, called the orbit.</p>
<p>Total revolving around the sun, nine planets. Most planets have natural satellites that move around the planets in their orbits. Earth has one satellite - the Moon, Mars - 2 Jupiter of 16 and up to 18 satellites of Saturn.</p>
<p>Also around the sun moving asteroids, comets and meteors.</p>
<p>Sun and planetary bodies: planets, their natural satellites, asteroids, comets, meteors, moving around the sun, the solar system formed.</p>
<p><b>The Earth - a planet of the solar system.</b></p>
<p><b>Globe - a model of the Earth.</b></p>
<p>The nearest star to Earth - the sun. Sunlight and heat lit and warmed the planet moving around the sun. The way in which the planet moves around the Sun, called the orbit.</p>
<p>Sun and planetary bodies - planets and their natural satellites, asteroids, comets, meteors, moving around the sun - form the solar system.</p>
<p>Earth is spherical, which is tilted at a certain angle. The diameter of the Earth 12 thousand. 756 km.</p>
<p>Exact reproduction of the Earth, reduced to tens of millions of times called - Globe. It consists of a ball, rotating around the axis. The axis of the globe is tilted at the same angle as our planet.</p>
<p>The Earth's axis - an imaginary line around which the Earth rotates. It passes through the center of the Earth and the poles. Above is the North Pole, South Pole and bottom. Equidistant from the poles is an imaginary line - Equator. The length of the equator - 40 thousand. Km. It divides the earth into two equal hemispheres - North and South.</p>
<p>Globe, a smaller version of Earth, helps to better see how our planet looks like, what is the relationship between her oceans and land, how the day and night and so on.</p>
