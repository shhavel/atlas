<p>56% of the area accounted for 153 of the object. Small areas of objects, their fragmentation, incoherence between them are the main destabilizing factors of nature reserve fund of Crimea.</p>
<p>Major protected areas are concentrated in the mountains and foothills of the Crimea. Highest values ​​in this figure reaches Yalta City Council (about 73%) in the Sevastopol and Alushta city council (30%). Especially difficult is the situation with the protection of natural ecosystems located within the steppe zone, where these ecosystems are the most intensively transformed. It was here that few existing reserves are very small in size, and are not provided to the full protection regime.</p>
<p>Razdolnensky and Leninsky districts have the highest percentage of the Crimea protected aquatic complexes.</p>
