<p>Interest in Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian gentry in the Polish model of the state, with its political rights and class privileges for the nobility.</p>
<p>Awareness of Ukrainian in the second half of the XVI century. need to find a reliable protection of their land, as opposition to the powers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania devastating raids of Tatar and Nogai hordes was ineffective.</p>
<p>Loss of Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the Livonian War, large areas, destroying the economy, human losses that threatened the entire submerged Moscow.</p>
<p>The desire of the Polish nobility to expand their holdings at a time when Poland itself free land almost was not.</p>

<p>On the Ukrainian lands were ceded to the Commonwealth, was introduced administrative divisions on the Polish example.</p>
<p><b>In the Commonwealth of Ukrainian lands was six provinces:</b></p>
<p>old - n (centered in Ukraine), Belz (Belz), Podolski (Kamenetz)</p>
<p>New - Volyn (Lutsk), Bratslav (Bratslav), Kiev (Kyiv)</p>
<p><b>The effects of the Lublin Union</b></p>
<p><b>The effects of the Lublin Union had the character of the distant future, as soon as the union is no significant change in the position of Ukrainian happened.</b></p>
<p>Since then, the fate of Ukrainian lands entirely dependent on external circumstances: while the direct owners of estates were princes who ruled them and the union until the state ruled a king who belonged to the understanding of local faith and morals, and before Ukrainian life if not experienced significant changes .</p>
<p>However, because of the union Polish magnates and gentry gained great opportunities for misappropriation of Ukrainian lands, ruthless exploitation of peasants and townspeople and spiritual enslavement Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Union of Lublin in the lands of the Kiev region, Bratslavshchina Zadneprovye began to appear new owners - Polish nobles, and with them spread filvarkova economic system of corvee and enslavement.</p>
<p>Particularly acute after the Union of Lublin became the problem of faith and language. The Catholic Church has sought to increase the number of its adherents. Therefore, the Ukraine Jesuit schools and colleges. They contributed to the spread of education: many Ukrainian were able to study in Western universities. However, payment for education often becomes renunciation native language and their ancestral faith. Since the XVI century. representatives of the lower classes had limited opportunities for education, Polonizing nobility meant the loss of Ukraine force capable of leading the struggle for the restoration of statehood.</p>
<p>Loss of statehood, which, though in a very limited form, but still remained in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania - the most dramatic consequence of the Lublin Union to Ukraine.</p>
