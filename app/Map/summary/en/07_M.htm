<p>Migration - Latin - relocation. External Migration - a movement of people from one country to another with the change of the place of residence either permanently or for an extended period. During external migration distinguish emigration (leaving the country to another), and immigration (entry of citizens of another state). On the number of population affected by external migration, immigration, in particular, contribute to the mechanical growth of the population. The difference between the number of immigrants and immigrant status is called migration balance. It can be positive (in the case of the predominance of people arrived), and negative if the number who left the country, more than the number of those who come into it.</p>
<p>External migration is always. They played a major role in the development of humanity, in particular, in the formation of the national structure of the population of many countries (US, Canada, Australia, South America, etc.). Causes external migrations can be economic, political, religious, family and household, environmental, natural (associated with natural phenomena - earthquakes, droughts, etc.). Economic factors are the most important in the world migration processes. Under economic reasons distinguish labor migration (job search) and brain drain (search-paid intellectual work by scientists and people of creative professions).</p>
<p>An important problem associated with external migration is the problem of refugees. More than 20 million people have in recent years forced migrants - refugees, due to international and inter-regional conflicts, civil wars, natural disasters, famine and poverty. Each country, anyway, is facing problems of migration by implementing immigration policy. Depending on the demographics and needs of their own economies, national governments stimulate or limit the influx of foreigners.</p>
