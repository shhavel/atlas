<p>After the events of 1917-1923 years. Political situation on the continent stabilized. Was overcome post-war economic crisis, some countries began a rapid economic growth, established boundaries, outlined new peace dohovramy. Came to power new political forces.</p>
<p>The first returned to a quiet life of the country and in North Western Europe. Here, a reformed, strengthened democratic institutions, economic development of nations has reached a new level. By the early 30s, these states have lived without major upheaval, leaving aside the powerful miners' strike that swept England in 1926</p>
<p>Much more complex processes taking place in Eastern and Southern Europe. These territories fierce struggle between left and right movements that ended not in favor of democracy. So in Hungary Horthy dictatorship established in Spain - Primo de Rivera in Bulgaria - Tsankov. In Italy started fast fascist country and strengthening the power of Mussolini, who set out to return the country grandeur of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>In the mid 20's authoritarian regimes came to power in Albania (Zog), the crisis of parliamentary republics: Portugal (Salazar), Poland (Pilsudski) and Lithuania (Smetona). But in Greece because of the military coup in 1924 overthrew the monarchy. After all the blame for the defeat in the war with Turkey, the public was laying on the king.</p>
<p>In 1929 as a result of the aggravation of the national problem in the Kingdom of C x C. King Alexander established a royal dictatorship, and the state renamed Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Island of stability in the region remained Austria and Czechoslovakia. The last 20-30 years has been a model of democratic development.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes were established in Europe in the 20's, kept the features of democracy (acting representative bodies, there was no mass arrests, there was a semblance of a multiparty system, the economy was stable up).</p>
<p>In the 1924-1932 biennium. Europe did not know, and war, except for a minor border incident between Greece and Bulgaria in 1925.</p>
<p>An important factor in the stability of international relations in Europe was the wave of diplomatic vyznannnya USSR (1924). However, the relationship between the West and the Soviet Union were unequal. The Soviet Union tried to remove from the solution of European Affairs, isolate, creating a country that had a common border with it, "sanitary zone". This caused distrust and sometimes led to an aggravation of relations. For example, in 1927 Britain broke off diplomatic relations with the USSR, that almost led to an armed conflict.</p>
<p>To break founded in 1922 Soviet-German alliance, the West concessions Germany. In 1924 they adopted the Dawes Plan, which eased her pay reparations. In 1925 the Ruhr were derived from the Franco-Belgian troops. That same year, the conference concluded at Locarno Rhine Pact warranty, which establishes the inviolability of borders between France, Belgium and Germany. In 1926, Germany became a member of the League of Nations. In 1929 for the Young Plan it significantly reduced the reparations payments.</p>
<p>In the 20's. Was made considerable progress in the development of international law. For the first time on a global scale discussed the problem of disarmament. However, it was doomed to failure because the Versailles-Washington system established inequality in arms because virtually all negotiations were aimed at fixing the situation.</p>
<p>However, in 1925 signed the Geneva Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, from which during the First World War affected about 1 million people. Also signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the barbarous weapon systems (bursting balloons, etc.) and on the rights of prisoners of war. The only European country that has not signed these conventions was the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On the initiative of French Foreign Minister Briand and US Secretary of State Kellogg in Paris August 27, 1928 15 states signed a pact Briand-Kellogg, which included the rejection of war as a means vyrishennnya interstate disputes.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the pact joined almost all European countries, including the USSR.</p>
<p>In September 1929 Briand made to the League of Nations with the new political initiator. He proposed the creation of a united Europe ("Pan-Europe"), that combine leading European states, setting between "somewhat like a federal ties." Next year Briand proposed a concrete plan to create a "European federal union" whereby European countries (except Turkey and the USSR) had gradually eliminate customs borders in order to create a "common market" and secure the guarantee of peace, adopted in Locarno. The "father of Europe" (a nickname later received Briand) critically met England, Italy, the US and other countries. Even Germany, which was counting on the support Briand, demanded preliminary political settlement in Europe, that is, the total elimination of Versailles. Thus, the idea of ​​a united Europe has not found support at that time.</p>
<p>In the late 20s the economic crisis that hit the US quickly overturned on Europe that disrupted the stability of the continent. The first victim of Germany, who was financially dependent on the United States. Then the crisis spread to other European countries, the least touching of France.</p>
<p>Each ideological force offered their recipes crisis. Slowly began to increase the credibility of extreme force - the Communists and the Nazis, who advocated radical pereustriy Europe.</p>
<p>An important event in the early 30's in Europe has been a revolution in Spain. Here bloodless monarchy was overthrown and the government dostupylysya Democrats. However, the revolutionary camp was scattered. Hope naselennnya to dramatic improvements were unjustified. Every year the country's growing political struggle that ultimately led to civil war 1936-1939 biennium.</p>
