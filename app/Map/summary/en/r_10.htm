<p>The biggest in the world is the Pacific Ocean - an area far exceeds the area of ​​all the continents of the Earth and is almost equal to the area of ​​all other oceans combined, and huge expanses determine significant diversity of natural - climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Name oceans gave the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. Led by the expedition crossed the ocean in 1520, during the circumnavigation.</p>
<p>Ocean floor topography is complex, due to the structural features of the crust. Seamounts, ridges, huge basins, troughs, submerged stretched on huge spaces, but most of the ocean floor is flat. In the Pacific marked the maximum depth of the oceans -11,022 m (Marianas Trench).</p>
<p>The vastness of the ocean due to significant differences in climate, which varies from hot to cold near the equator in the northern and southern parts. In addition, for violation of the ocean are characterized by zonal temperature distribution in temperate and tropical latitudes.</p>
<p>A rich and varied organic world ocean. This is particularly evident in the warm latitudes near the coast of the mainland in the near-surface waters. Thousands of species of fish, clams, mussels; seals, dolphins, whales and other marine depths represented by the living world ocean.</p>
<p>The wealth of biological resources are attracted to areas of ocean scientists, tourists and fishermen. From humanity gets more than half of the world's catch of seafood. In shelf areas of the ocean floor revealed significant deposits of oil and gas and other mineral resources.</p>
<p>Because the oceans are important shipping routes, ocean water is very contaminated. Also significant are the environmental problems associated with the testing of nuclear weapons that once were made in the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Indian Ocean is relatively small, but very diverse topography. The greatest form of relief is the mid-ocean ridge that three branches diverging from the center. Underwater margin of Eurasia in the northern part of the ocean is increasing due to the large amount of sedimentary material given by rivers. Continental slope in the Gulf Benґalskiy rapidly descends to the ocean floor. At the Sunda Islands series of underwater ridges represented hundreds of volcanoes, one third of which - acting. Here is the deepest portion of the ocean - Sunda Trench, 7729 m.</p>
<p>Climate of the Indian Ocean with a wide latitudinal distinct zonation in temperature and rainfall. Water temperature and air dropping of the equator and the tropics. Varies considerably depending on the ratio of precipitation and evaporation of water salinity (from 34 & permil; at the equator and 35-37 & permil; in the tropics, to 42 & permil; the Red Sea). In general, the water of the Indian Ocean is the warmest and most salty sea in the oceans.</p>
<p>Significant impact on ocean climate makes Eurasia through monsoon circulation. Winter powerful cooled air masses move from land to ocean. In summer, on the contrary, moist oceanic air masses move inland. Effects of atmospheric air circulation results in the so-called monsoon circulation of ocean currents, water half South trade wind and monsoon currents move clockwise and six months - against it.</p>
<p>Many organic world and the natural resources of the ocean and its location (main sea routes connecting the ports of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans) identified long-standing development and intensive use of water areas. In the Indian Ocean basin are major oil and one of the largest gas producing regions of the world - the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>However, heavy use of ocean pollution is a serious threat not only to aquatic areas, but for coastal areas.</p>
<p>The smallest and most shallow ocean planet are the Arctic Ocean. Natural boundaries of ocean shores is Eurasia and North America, some of which are many marginal seas, bays and islands. As the number of islands of the Arctic Ocean is second only to the Pacific.</p>
<p>The main features of the topography of the ocean floor is no transition zone and impressive size shelf (up to 1 300 km wide), occupying half the area of ​​the ocean floor.</p>
<p>The climate of the ocean is determined by its position and relatively small size. In winter, the temperature of surface waters throughout is negative and ice covered 90% of the surface. In summer the temperature rises to + 5 ° C to form off the coast of continents arrays floating ice.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of permanent ice cover over most of the ocean currents Ocean weakly related to atmospheric circulation. Much greater impact on their formation are waters of the Atlantic Ocean, powerful flow moving along the Eurasia to Berynґovoyi Strait. The waters of the Arctic Ocean are relatively low salinity.</p>
<p>The organic world ocean rather poor except for its Atlantic seaboard of the reason for this - the harsh climatic conditions. The complexity of the natural environment explains the limited use of ocean resources.</p>
