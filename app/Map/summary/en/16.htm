<p>After the defeat of the liberation struggle in western lands were part of Poland, Romania and Czechoslovakia. To the Polish occupation hit the ground in Eastern Galicia and Western Volhynia, where, according to the census of 1931, population of 5.6 million Ukrainian. As part of the Romanian Ukrainian (790 ths. Persons) living in Northern Bukovina, Khotyn, Akkerman, and Izmail districts of Bessarabia. On the territory of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, which was part of Czechoslovakia, lived more than 450 thousand. Ukrainian. Each of the states comprised of Ukrainian lands, was to determine in relation to the Ukrainian minority.</p>
<p>In general, we can determine traits such policy in Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia: a) forced assimilation; b) deter economic development, its colonial character; c) repression against activists of the national liberation movement; d) national oppression; d) failure of the international obligation to provide autonomous rights of Ukrainian.</p>
<p>The forms in which this policy was carried out, varied - from soft to hard in Czechoslovakia in Romania. In Poland, where the population of the largest Ukrainian, besides a high national consciousness, Ukrainian question was most acute. The Polish government is pursuing a strategic goal - full Polonizing seized Ukrainian lands, depending on internal and external circumstances corrected its course. For the 1919-1939 biennium. Clearly distinguished three periods of Polish policy of the ruling circles to Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>In 1919-1923. Polish authorities tried to prove to the world community of their rights in the Ukrainian land, and that Poland allegedly provides all of the rights of national minorities. Polish Constitution of 1921 guaranteed the right to use their native Ukrainian language in everyday life and in teaching in elementary schools. In addition, the Act of 26 March 1922 gave the government Eastern Galicia (Lviv, Stanislav, Ternopil province). But as soon as March 14, 1923 Council ambassadors of Britain, France, Italy and Japan recognized the Eastern part of Poland, Galicia, these rights remain on paper. During this period, Ukrainian is also trying to defend their rights by resorting to protests, armed attacks boycott Census 1921, election in 1922 to the Diet. But the existence of the Ukrainian state, no one in Europe was not interested.</p>
<p>In the 1923-1926 biennium. Polish ruling circles aggressively pursued policies aimed at assimilation of oppressed peoples. For this purpose the Polish government has divided the country into two economic territory: Poland "A", which included indigenous Polish lands, and Poland "B" - mostly Western and Belarusian lands. According to the different parts performed and different policies. Regarding Poland "B" applied artificial containment policy of socio-economic development and the full withdrawal of concessions to national minorities. July 31, 1924 a law was passed, by which it proclaimed the Polish state. Began closing Ukrainian schools. The Polish government was trying to erase the very concept of "Ukraine", "Ukrainian". In Ukrainian, Polish ground moved colonists who stood the best land. During the 1921-1929 biennium. Moved here 77 thousand. Poles.</p>
<p>The political crisis in 1926 led to a new turn in policy towards Ukrainian. The third period (1926-1937 gg.) Associated with the establishment of the regime "readjustment" headed by J. Pilsudski. The new policy included some concessions and compromises in dealing with ethnic minorities, including Ukrainian. The essence of the course was to state the assimilation of national minorities and the rejection of national assimilation. An important element of the new model of national policy was an attempt to transform Volhynia in the "cradle of the Polish-Ukrainian agreement." It increased public investment in Volhynia, the mass creation of bilingual schools, is allowed a Ukrainianization Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>This policy was carried out for the purpose of division among Ukrainian: between Galicians and Volinians between supporters and opponents of the agreement with Poland. It was to be a positive image of Poland as a state that is tolerant of minorities, and to appeal to Ukrainians against the backdrop of a tough anti-Ukrainian policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. In 1935 the largest Ukrainian Ukrainian Party of People's Democratic Alliance has policy of "normalization" of Polish-Ukrainian relations. Its leader V. Wise became the Vice Marshal of the Polish Sejm. There were amnestied prisoners camp in Bereza Kartuska.</p>
<p>But since 1937, the Polish ruling circles again change course. In the face of the Second World War, they were afraid that the Ukrainian question becomes a bargaining chip in the big game, and any concessions Ukrainian fertile soil for the growth of separatism. A new wave of repression.</p>
<p>The policy regarding CSR Ukrainian also has several stages. In the early 1920's. Czech government tried to create the impression of conscientious fulfillment of their international obligations concerning the provision of Subcarpathian Rus' autonomous rights specified in Saint-Germain agreement. His delay in granting autonomy they explained unpreparedness population of the region to independent living through poor education and lack of trained personnel.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 1920s - 1930s. Czechoslovak government held a series of reforms designed to ensure the implementation of the system of education, land reform and so on. Through these activities, he has made an effort to distract people from the struggle for autonomy, focusing his attention on the "language issue".</p>
<p>In the second half of the 1930s. Government circles Czechoslovakia faced with the deployment of new struggles for autonomy and public pressure finally forced to Germany in October 1938 to provide edge autonomy.</p>
<p>As in Poland, Czechoslovakia government circles were not conducive to the development of the regional economy. They realized that the edge is part of Czechoslovakia temporarily and develop only those industries that do not require substantial investment.</p>
<p>Romania initially working towards full assimilation Ukrainian, depriving them of any chance to develop. In the economy of the region have not received any investment. Unemployment, lack of land, predatory use of natural resources - this is what characterized the position of the edge.</p>
<p>Only in 1927 formed the party that defended the national interests of Ukrainian - Ukrainian National Party (UNP). It was the liberal party, which operated exclusively legal methods. The leader of the party was V. Zolozetskyy. The younger generation of Ukrainian leaders, dissatisfied with the moderate policies of the UNP, in mid-1930. Created a conspiratorial radical nationalist organization, similar in software principles and actions of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN).</p>
<p>Despite the anti-Ukrainian policy of the ruling circles of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania, their political regimes allow some political freedom. Using this feature, Ukrainian political party created, designed to protect their interests. In Poland in 1925, there were 12 Ukrainian political parties representing a wide political spectrum. UNDO, which was formed in 1925, was essentially a liberal party intellectual elite of the region. The leaders of the association were D. Levitsky, W. Wise, S. Ram, A. Luck. UNDO advocated for constitutional democracy and the independence of Ukraine. A significant political force was the Ukrainian Social Radical Party (MSzMP), which was formed as a party of the socialist movement. Her support farmers, rural intelligentsia. Radicals sought to combine the principle of democratic socialism with the idea of ​​the independence of Ukraine. Addressing the major socio-economic problems associated with independence. Its leaders were L. Ermakov and J. Makuch. Another influential political force of the Communist Party of Eastern Galicia, which in 1923 evolved into the Communist Party of Western Ukraine (CPWU) and joined the Communist Party of Poland. Led CPWU were clergymen J., R. Kuzma. Politics of Ukrainian and NEP, conducted in the USSR contributed to the growing influence CPWU. But the following policy of the Soviet leadership (collectivization, famine, repression) caused criticism from members CPWU. During his stay in the USSR, many Western Communists were arrested, and the Communist Party of Poland, which included CPWU by the decision of the Comintern dissolved.</p>
<p>Ukrainian parties tried to make the most legitimate opportunities to influence the formation of internal policy. To this end, they fought for a place in the Polish Parliament: in November 1927 Ukrainian representation in the Diet consisted of 25 ambassadors and 6 Senators in July 1930 - with 50 ambassadors and 14 senators.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Transcarpathian Ukraine found itself as a part of Czechoslovakia. For Saint-Germain treaty Czechoslovakia was to grant autonomy to the territory. But under the Constitution of 1920 Czechoslovakia became a unitary state. Failure to comply with the promises the government of Czechoslovakia explained unpreparedness edge to the government because of the low level of education, lack of political elites.</p>
<p>Munich Agreement in 1938 forced the government of Czechoslovakia to reorganize the country on a federal basis. Before Transcarpathia The opportunity eventually get autonomy. Population of the province mainly supported Russophile movement. So October 11, 1938 the government instructed the leader of Czechoslovakia Rusyn A. Brodiyu form an autonomous administration. Prior to administration of autonomy includes representatives of people '(Ukrainian) movement. After a while populist movement leader Alexander Voloshin instructed to form the administration of autonomy. A. Brody was accused of collaboration with the Hungarian intelligence in an effort to connect the country to Hungary. The new administration of the province found itself in a difficult position. From Transcarpathia by the decision of the First Vienna Award were alienated most economically developed regions and the city of Uzhgorod, Mukachevo, Riverside and others, which were transferred to Hungary.</p>
<p>Everywhere were diversionary troops from Hungary and Poland, which destabilized the situation.</p>
<p>However, the autonomous administration of the province undertook to active state-business. Not having enough support among the population, she sought help from the OUN leaders of which occupied the most important positions in the Transcarpathian administration of the province and took to create militias.</p>
<p>State-building processes in the region began to develop in accordance with the theory of integral nationalism. Yes, it was forbidden activities of all political parties except the Ukrainian National Association. All dissenters were isolated in a concentration camp (it was not a death camp, which formed the Nazis). Elections in January 1939 was rigged as a result it turned out that for UNF voted 86% of voters. Trying to create militias "Carpathian Sich" has caused a conflict with the Czechs. So, on the night of 13 to 14 March 1939 of the Czech-Slovak army defeated squads "Carpathian Sich", who tried to seize weapons from the warehouse, and then removed the moderate leadership of Carpatho-Ukraine. This conflict came on the eve of the invasion of the province of Hungarian troops. March 14, 1939 40 thousandth Hungarian army invaded the territory of the region. Czech army on orders from Prague did not resist. Under these difficult circumstances to protect the land became squads "Carpathian Sich" (2 ths. Persons). Decisive battles unfolded on the field during the Red Hust. Meanwhile, March 15, 1939 in the premises of school going Justa Diet, which was proclaimed the independence of Carpatho-Ukraine. The Sejm passed a bill that included the following:</p>
<p>"1.Karpatska Ukraine is an independent state.</p>
<p>2.Nazva States are: Carpatho-Ukraine.</p>
<p>3.Karpatska Ukraine is a republic headed by the president, elected by the Sejm of Carpatho-Ukraine.</p>
<p>4.Derzhavnoyu language of Carpatho-Ukraine is Ukrainian.</p>
<p>5.Barvamy national flag of Carpatho-Ukraine is a blue and yellow ... "</p>
<p>President of the Carpatho-Ukraine elected Voloshin. The meeting of the Sejm took place in conditions approaching Hungarian troops. March 18, the territory was fully occupied. Government Carpathian Ukraine emigrated to Romania. By the end of April some sections, using guerrilla methods of struggle, resisting the Hungarian invaders, but to stop the aggression failed. In addition, Carpathian Ukraine found itself in international isolation. Stalin, the Soviet leadership was put to her with open hostility, seeing is dangerous hotbed Ukrainian samostiynytstva.</p>
<p>Carpathian Ukraine lasted only a few days. The historical significance of the independent state karpatoukrayintsiv was that it was once again demonstrated an overwhelming desire of the Ukrainian people to create their own state. In addition, the Western population peresvidchylos in danger of insolvency and guidance in support of foreign states. It became clear that the interest of Germany "Ukrainian question" was motivated by the desire to use it for their own expansionist purposes.</p>
