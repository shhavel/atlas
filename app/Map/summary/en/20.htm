<p>Availability and use of recreational resources play an important role in the economic development of many countries. In particular, the European countries have a unique combination of natural and recreational, cultural and historical resources, which together with the development of transport infrastructure and good service each year attract many foreign tourists. Significant recreational resources are available to the countries of Asia, but political instability in many regions of the world that hinders their full use. Ample opportunities in the development of cognitive and sports tourism are African, but because of the low economic development (in particular this underdeveloped transport and services), they are used very little.</p>
<p>Rapidly developing oceanic tourism. Space oceans and seas provide excellent conditions for cruise tourism. Travelling in comfortable sea liners allow wealthy tourists to get acquainted with the exotic countries, visiting the most remote corners of the planet.</p>
