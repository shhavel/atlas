<p>In Eurasia, are all natural zones of the Northern Hemisphere. In the western part of the continent prevailing influence of the Atlantic Ocean led to changing environmental zones in the direction from northwest to southeast. In the eastern part of Eurasia natural areas with meridional strike, due to the monsoon circulation of air masses on prytyhookeanskiy area. Natural areas inside of the continent vary in latitudinal direction by changing the temperature and humidification mode in the direction from north to south.</p>
<p>Polar desert with extremely harsh climatic conditions covers the Arctic Islands. There is no solid ground cover and poor vegetation consists of lightweight warmth species that survive in permafrost. The animals are common polar bears, walruses, seals, reindeer.</p>
<p>Due to mitigating the impact of the North Atlantic current area of ​​tundra and forest tundra have differences in their western and eastern parts. At the European mainland coast climate is moderately cold and tundra here extends northward beyond anywhere on the planet. With promotion to east climatic conditions become more severe, and tundra and forest tundra take up more space. For mountain range in Siberia tundra vegetation penetrates far to the south. Among the plants is dominated by mosses and lichens growing on the tundra-gley soils. Because permafrost moisture is not held inside, so there are many swamps. Major animals: reindeer, arctic foxes, some species of birds.</p>
<p>Further south tundra goes into the taiga. In a more warm and humid climate here on podzolic soils formed vast tracts of coniferous forests of spruce, pine and larch (the only conifer that drops needles in the winter). The latter predominates in Asian taiga, in terms of colder extreme continental climate. Mostly very swampy taiga, many are peat and sedge marshes. Is extremely diverse fauna (brown bear, elk, black grouse, wolves, grouse).</p>
<p>Areas of mixed and deciduous forests are most common in the western part of Eurasia. Here under high humidification on sod-podzolic soils grow spruce-oak and pine-oak forests in western Siberia - pine and birch and aspen forests. Further east mixed forests disappear and appear again only on the Pacific coast. Broadleaf forests formed mostly from oak and beech and hornbeam, maple, linden.</p>
<p>For areas lisostepivistepiv are several zonal differences caused significant climate change with the advance from the west to the east of the continent. In a warm climate and low moisture south the East European Plain formed fertile black soil and gray forest soils. The flora is represented by small areas of forest (oak, birch, linden, maple). In the eastern part of the continent with increases in the amplitude of the temperature and increasing dry climate soils are often saline. The flora is poorer and presented mainly grasses and shrubs. The most common wildlife steppes and steppes are wolves, foxes, squirrels, voles, jerboa and steppe birds. Forest and steppe almost entirely under cultivation, and the natural vegetation is preserved only in protected areas and areas unsuitable for plowing.</p>
<p>Large areas of central and south-western parts of the continent is occupied zone and semi-deserts. Desert zone extends across three geographical zones. Common to all is a small desert rainfall, poor soils and vegetation that is well adapted to the harsh conditions. The deserts of the Arabian Peninsula stand high temperatures throughout the year, small (up to 100 mm per year) rainfall and mostly flat surface. Desert subtropics (the Iranian plateau, Central Asia, part of the Gobi desert) are characterized by significant variations in temperature, richer vegetation, a large number of animal species. Sand or stone-covered desert temperate Karakum desert, the Taklamakan, Gobi out of the big hot summers and severe frosts in winter.</p>
<p>Savannas and woodlands area occupies most of the Indian subcontinent, as well as large areas of Indochina. Under these conditions in monsoonal climate savannahs of tall grasses growing rare palms and acacia that sometimes changing areas of forests. Some trees in the dry season for several months shed leaves. The fauna is represented by elephants, tigers, rhinos, lots of reptiles.</p>
<p>Area tverdolystyh evergreen forests and shrubs (Mediterranean) is the Mediterranean. In a warm and wet winter and hot summer is growing evergreen trees and shrubs, most typical of which is stone and cork oaks, laurel and arbutus, pine. However, due to intensive economic development of the area of ​​primary vegetation is heavily modified. Regular feature of the local landscape are vineyards, olive plantations, fields of wheat and other crops, which lie in the former Mediterranean forests.</p>
<p>Variable humid zone (including monsoon) forest stretches east and south of Eurasia. Vegetation is represented as conifers and deciduous trees (cedar, pine, oak, walnut, gingko) and evergreen trees (palms, ficus, bamboo and magnolias), growing mainly in the red-yellow soils. The fauna is also characterized by a significant diversity of species: monkeys, tigers, leopards, and endemic - Bamboo Bear (Panda), gibbon and more.</p>
<p>The wealth of flora and fauna typical of the area humid equatorial forests of Eurasia. Only trees here are up to 300 species, many species of bamboo, which is widely used in work and life. Forests form a high (70 m) trees, some of which are mahogany. Among the impenetrable thicket can be found here orangutans, leopards, tapirs. Many reptiles and reptiles and insects.</p>
<p>Because a significant number of mountain ranges, with different height and distance from the ocean, high-altitude zone of Eurasia is characterized by a different number of zones. In the mountains of the northern part of the continent, only four belts replace each other. Further south is the number of zones increases to five and seven in the Alps on the southern slopes of the Himalayas. A large number of zones is explained by the highest level of the Himalayas, while the northern slopes of the mountains due to the extreme dryness of the climate was formed only two zones.</p>
