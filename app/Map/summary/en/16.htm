<p>Land - land that is used or may be used in human activities. Of the 149.4 million square kilometers. land surface of 134 million square kilometers. falls on its land fund. Diagrams to map shows the structure of the land fund and its distribution in different regions of the planet.</p>
<p>The greatest human impacts experienced agricultural land and land settlements. Agricultural lands are most productive. Arable land (arable land) - is part of the land fund, from which humanity receives up to 80% of food products. Availability of arable land by region of the world is very uneven. It depends on the environmental conditions and the level of agricultural development of the territory, culture management. Among the regions of the world arable land is allocated the largest share of Europe. Here, the least unsuitable for land use, high culture farming, mostly favorable climate and topography. Among the countries largest areas of arable land are the USA, China, India, Canada, Kazakhstan, Ukraine. Every year, the agricultural area decreases. Reasons include opencast mining, flooding of land being built reservoirs, low culture of management (as a result - land degradation and desertification of them). Under the degradation of agricultural land, scientists understand the depletion of land, loss of fertility and soil erosion, pollution, reduction in the biological productivity of natural pastures, salinization and waterlogging of irrigated areas. At the same time, population growth and reducing land provision required to increase the area of ​​agricultural land and more efficient use of already cultivated land.</p>
