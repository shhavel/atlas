<p>In 1880 is flourishing Ukrainian theater. This was due to the fact that only in the theater was possible to develop the Ukrainian language. The best playwrights were also directors and managers theater company. Ukrainian professional theater came at the amateur groups operating in the 1860-1870 years.

In Western Ukraine should mention the work of M. Verbitsky.</p>
<p>In Ukrainian architecture of the second half of the XIX century. eclecticism extends a variety of styles. The most significant achievements in this period were the architects A. Beretta (St. Vladimir's Cathedral, home of the first school in Kiev), V. Schroeder (the opera house and theater Solovtsova in Kiev), P. Glavka (home residence of Metropolitan of Bukovina Chernivtsi) .</p>
<p>Thus, the second half of the XIX century. was difficult and controversial period in the development of Ukrainian culture. Despite the difficulties, the culture was enriched by remarkable achievements in all major industries.</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century. in the cultural sphere clearly silhouetted two trends - the preservation of national cultural identity (populism) and transplantation on Ukrainian soil samples newest European artistic self-expression (modernism). Synteznoyu characteristic model of populism and modernism was "new school" Ukrainian prose (Kotsyubinsky, V. Stefanik, A. Helmers, M. Cheremshyna), which in their work seamlessly combine traditional etnohrafizm national literature, the story in the first person and others. with the latest European achievements - and psyhoanalizmom symbolism.</p>
<p>Ukrainian literature first modernist slogans put forward in 1901 the poet M. Blackie, who on the 'Literary and Scientific Bulletin "on the software open letter called back to the idea of" real sweet poetry' content and genre enhance existing in literature framework. Relay M. Voronoi adopted Galician writers group "Young Muse" (P. Karmansky, W. Paczkowski, A. Lutsk et al.), Which in 1907 published its manifesto that contained criticisms of realism in literature and focusing on Europe-wide patterns and trends.</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth century. - In the early twentieth century. Nouveau becoming widespread in Ukrainian architecture, which found its expression in a geometrically precise lines of buildings, their dynamic form. This style is built railway station in Lviv, Kyiv, Zhmerinka, Kharkiv, Ukraine's first indoor market (Bessarabian). The brightest figures of architectural modernism were V. Zhukov, O. Verbitsky, M. Verovkin et al. Search and experiments architects modernists sought to maximize the functionality of the building, while maintaining clarity in the lines of the facade.</p>
<p>Ukrainian sculpture of the early twentieth century. also did not avoid the modernist beginnings. Under the influence of Western art schools formed a galaxy of Ukrainian modernist sculptors - Gavrilko M., M. Parashchuk, V. Ishchenko, P. Viytovych et al. Their creativity inherent contrast black and white effects and psychological insight Alexander Archipenko enriched the language of the twentieth century .: He made an empty space to be organic and very expressive element composition. Hand of the master are "treading woman", "woman who zachisuyetsya" and other works.</p>
<p>Supporters in painting modernist experimenters were M. Zuk, Nowakowski, W. and F. Krichevsky et al.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that the Ukrainian version of modernism was quite original and has its own characteristics. Due to the fact that the Ukrainian lands had their own state, had been separated and were actually in the status of provincial social development, they have slow compared with the leading European countries, hence the conflict between civilization and culture, the artist and society were not as sharp . These factors are identified and obscure, poorly expressed, immature nature of Ukrainian modernism. Some World-ups only vidtinyaly general provincialism and deep traditional Ukrainian culture.</p>
<p>Ukrainian modernism emerged as a national not original current, and was detected only in the works of different artists. This style, especially in literature, was a significant influence of romanticism, because of how tradition and mentality of the Ukrainian people, to which romanticism is an organic element in the outlook any day. The peculiarity of the Ukrainian version of modernism lies in the fact that he was of the aesthetic phenomenon into a cultural and historical phenomenon, was an attempt to overcome provincialism, of secondary importance, secondary Ukrainian national culture, a form of involvement of mankind. He seemed to symbolize the transition of Ukrainian society from ethnographic consumer identity, ie distinguishing themselves from others, to national self - determination of their place and role in the modern world.</p>
