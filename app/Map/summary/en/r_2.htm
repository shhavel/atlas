<p>The Earth's surface is extremely diverse. For a long geological history appeared mountains and plains, deep ravines and slopes, and in those places, where the sea millions of years ago ascend the mountain. Thus, under the influence of internal and external processes formed the present topography.</p>
<p>The major forms of the earth's surface is ocean basins and continents, as they are called planetary. The major landforms on the continents and ocean basins are mountains and plains. Mountain vary in age, height, appearance and conditions of their formation. Typically, the mountains consist of several ranges. By age, they are old and young. The highest mountain system in the world is the Himalayas, there is also the highest peak - G. Dzhomolunґma (8848 m).</p>
<p>The plains are also distinguished by age and origin: some took the place of the seabed as a result of uplift of the crust, while others are the result of the destruction of the mountains. Some are plain faced as a result of long flowing waters, eroding and carrying rocks, forming giant flat space (Indo-Ґanґska, Mesopotamian plain, etc.).</p>
<p>Ocean floor also has its own topography. The plains and mountains of the land on the edge of the underwater continental mainland are moving in shallow (shelf) and continental slope. Then go deep into the basin, submarine ridges, deep sea trenches (the deepest in the world - Marianas, 11 022 m). Grand edifice is a mid-ocean ridges that constitute a single mountain system that stretches across all oceans 75 000 km.</p>
<p>Formation of relief has a certain pattern and is closely related to the structure of the crust. Plains formed mostly of sedimentary rocks (clay, sand, gravel), located on the hard rocks (granite, gneiss). These relatively stable and aligned structures that lie beneath the plains, called platforms. Parts of the platform, where a layer of hard rock (foundation) is obtained from the sediment loose rocks (cover) are called shields. Mantle-covered area called plates.</p>
<p>Platforms are under the plains and relatively monolithic. Moving away crust, folding area, resulting from the collision of lithospheric plates and cause the formation of mountains. At the bottom of the ocean in places divergence of lithospheric plates formed the rift - breaks a depth of several kilometers. As it rises hot mantle that hardens to form mid-ocean ridges.</p>
<p>Significant impact on the Earth's topography with external forces. Water, wind, glaciers are the creators of river valleys, caves, stone pillars dunes. A variety of living organisms leave behind holes, nests, Coral reef and more. Mostly changing the Earth's surface and man: dams, piles, mines, canals - landforms that are created as a result of human activities.</p>
