<p>Kyiv - a big modern city. Every year it becomes more and vporyadkovanishym. But along with the rapid construction are fewer green spaces, natural ponds, the free development of territories. The process of urban development designed to provide a modern infrastructure: roads, residential areas, efficient transport system. However there is a need to preserve the natural resources of the city, to minimize the consequences of anthropogenic impact on nature.</p>
<p>The territory of modern Kyiv - more than 800 km sq., Of which the solid construction is about 40%. The rest is occupied by green areas (parks and gardens) and the reservoir. In per capita green area is 214 sq. M, which is one of the highest in the world.</p>
<p>Our city is located on the border of the forest and steppe natural zones and almost all sides surrounded with great forests, forest Sviatoshynskyi, Pusha-Vodytskyy forest, Concha Zaspa, Darnitckiy forest, Holosiyivsky forest. In Kiev the forest is dominated by pine and birch. Forests of the right bank of Kiev formed mainly of deciduous and coniferous species (oak, maple, linden, pine, birch). It is due largely to forests air of the city is much cleaner than the air many other industrial centers. The forests around Kyiv live many animals and birds (rabbit, deer, hedgehog, heron, owl). However, a significant number of animals live quite near to us, in the basement, city parks and on rooftops. Most of them, of course, we are deeply sympathetic and deserve our help (especially in the cold season). Therefore, it is useful to treat a dog or cat yard or make your own feeder for tits. However, there are & laquo; & raquo ;, citizens that cause us much trouble. Such, for example, is a rat that can carry serious illnesses, damage communication and even attack people.</p>
