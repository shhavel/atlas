<p>One of the main components of Ukraine's economy is agriculture. Products industry provides internal needs of the country and exported to international markets. Agriculture is the primary element of the agroindustrial complex (AIC), along with some food and light industry are its foundation.</p>
<p>The elements of agriculture are crop (cereals, industrial, fodder crops, potatoes, gardening, etc.) and livestock (cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, and other areas)</p>
<p>The development of agriculture depends on natural geographic and socio-economic conditions. Generally very favorable agro-climatic and soil and land conditions are zonal distribution. Therefore, in Ukraine there are three agricultural zones: Woodlands, forest-steppe and steppe, and two mountain regions: Carpathian and Crimean. On this background, there were azonal suburban areas that provide food city and metropolitan area. Socio-economic factors in the development field include provision of labor resources, especially land tenure, agricultural policy of the state.</p>
<p>Maps acreage, Grain crops, industrial crops, vegetables and Kartoplyay melons submit an overall picture of the structure and size of acreage and gross yield of major crops.</p>
<p>It is well known that in Ukraine is a significant amount of the world's reserves of black soil - fertile soil, which was one of the main prerequisites for the rich agricultural traditions of our people. Up to 70% of the land fund of the state are agricultural land (arable land, plantations, pastures, hayfields), however, they are used inefficiently. In addition, over 80% of agricultural land is under cultivation, which also adversely affected soils. In addition, due to the use of manual labor and low-skilled predominantly extensive management, in which the increase in production was supplied mainly by attracting into circulation new lands and increasing livestock farming is low performing. It should also take into account the fact that the earlier rural workers were excluded from the means of production and land. To solve this problem carried out is intended to land reform. In recent years, gained widespread sharing (transfer to private ownership) of land, the establishment of peasant (farmer) facilities, attract new agricultural techniques and modern technology. This radically changes the situation for the better in the industry.</p>
