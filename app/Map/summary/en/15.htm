<p>Oceans is a source of vital importance to human resources: biological, mineral, energy. Biological resources include fish, shellfish (oysters, mussels), crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, shrimp), marine mammals (whales, walruses, seals) and some seaweed (kelp, gelidium). The richest industrialized are coastal (offshore) zone of seas and oceans.</p>
<p>On the bottom and under the ocean floor are potential mineral resources, including oil, gas, sulfur, construction materials, ferromanganese nodules and phosphorite. The most important among them is oil. All the world knows of more than 400 oil and gas fields, half of them located on the continental shelf and slope. Extraction of marine oil is growing very fast. According to forecasts, the offshore wells will give a third of its oil.</p>
<p>Ferromanganese nodules are nearly spherical shape formation of oxides and hydroxides of iron and manganese with a concentric internal structure. Yet they can be presented in the form of crusts on the bottom of volcanic rocks. Regardless of the type of ferromanganese deposits they are formed by chemical sedimentation of these elements from ocean waters. Many nodules containing high concentrations of nickel, copper and cobalt which can be used in industry.</p>
<p>Phosphorite nodules are found mainly on continental margins. They are formed from the remains of living organisms that have been preserved in the solid and unconsolidated sediments of organic origin.</p>
<p>Bottom sediments, the so-called red clay, formed at the bottom of the ocean from sedimentation rich in iron oxides and clay minerals mining residues detrital material brought into the ocean from the continents by rivers, wind, glaciers.</p>
<p>Some of the mineral resources of the ocean are already in use, while others are waiting for the time when these are exhausted sources of raw materials on land.</p>
<p>Mineral resources of the oceans also include resources that are contained in sea water: salt, magnesium, bromine, gold and other elements.</p>
<p>Energy resources of the oceans:</p>
<p>tidal energy;</p>
<p>energy of ocean currents;</p>
<p>the energy of the sea;</p>
<p>energy difference in temperature of the surface and deep waters.</p>
<p>Among the most energy resources used tidal energy. Construction of tidal power plants (TPP) is possible in the long and narrow bays, where the height of the tidal waves up to ten or more meters (France, Britain, Russia, Canada, USA, Norway, Argentina and other coastal countries).</p>
<p>Ocean and sea coasts of many countries are widely used as recreational resources of the oceans.</p>
