<p>After the consolidation of his power, the Bolsheviks began a radical pereustriy country, called "Soviet modernization."</p>
<p>Modernization of the Soviet Ukraine: industrialization, collectivization, mass repression, "cultural revolution".</p>
<p>In December 1925 held XIV Congress of the CPSU (b), which declared the policy of industrialization of the USSR. Next XV Congress in 1927 recognized the priority of the state plan in the market, which meant the collapse of the NEP and the destruction of commodity-money relations. According to Stalin's plans were not predicting the wear and prescriptive, that is to be binding. It was supposed to achieve 19% annual growth of industrial production, and in 1929. XVI Conference of the ACP (B) adopted even higher growth rates. Opponents of emergency measures and rush - Bukharin, Rykov, A., M. Tomsk and others - were declared "right draft dodgers" and during the "cleansing" of the party are excluded from its ranks. Based on the parameters of the first five-year plan for 1928/29 - 1932/33 biennium. Respectively were developed plans for the economic development of Ukraine, adopted XI Ukrainian Congress of Soviets.</p>
<p>First Five-Year Plan was the amount of annual plans that are constantly upward adjustment was made. Ukraine set for intense growth rate of heavy machinery, chemical industry, production of electricity. In fact reinforced structure of the economy, is not intended to introduce new technologies, and to use energy and raw materials.</p>
<p>Amid the global economic crisis of 1929-1933. Impression rapid economic progress in the USSR. This led to the Bolshevik leaders desire to further stretch the power of the people and make a big leap into socialism. Stalin instituted the growth rate of industrial production in the second year of five-year 32%, and more - 45%. This "nadindustrializatsiya" is not reinforced by real possibilities. Industries in developed ahead of others behind. As a result, new construction projects not enough money, skills and equipment. To attract new resources taken any measures.</p>
<p>Sources industrialazatsiyi: revenues of the public sector; revenues from the state monopoly on foreign trade, increased exports of raw materials and agricultural products abroad; "Price scissors" between industrial and agricultural products; nationalization of industry, the elimination of the private sector (clotting NEP); cancellation convert ducats, inflation; increase output quotas while maintaining existing wages; lengthening of the working day; collectivization "cannibalization"; coercive government loans; labor of prisoners; labor enthusiasm, Stakhanov movement; higher prices for wine and spirits drinks; sale abroad of national cultural values; anti-religious campaign, robbing churches; increase in direct and indirect taxes; introduction of rationing food distribution and basic necessities; decline in living standards.</p>
<p>There was such a thing as "overflow" when capital construction plans reviewed repeatedly, but each of them was executed.</p>
<p>During the First Five-Year Plan in Ukraine was built about 400 new businesses, including the Dnieper hydroelectric, tool steel plant in Zaporozhye "DSS", Kharkov tractor plant mines in the Donbas and others. A large industry of Ukraine passed under the authority of Union Commissariat. Thus, Ukraine, like other republics, was deprived of economic independence. Administrative and legislative management practices were central to the development of the Soviet economy.</p>
<p>To prove the triumph of the first five, Stalin manipulated statistical indicators. Special decision of the Politburo of separate agencies were forbidden to publish the results of their work. The growth of industrial output was applied not in a particular year, and in rubles. So, it was enough to set great prices on new products, as gross indicators dramatically increased. This made it possible to announce the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan for 4 years and 3 months. The annual growth of industrial production averaged about 16%, or less than planned.</p>
<p>During the Second Five-Year Plan 1933 - 1937 рр. Growth rates were estimated to be 16.5%. Ukraine has entered into a giant steel industry - Zaporozhstal, Krivorizhstal, Works and Novokramatorsky Heavy Machinery Plant - one of the largest in Europe.</p>
<p>Implementation of the first five require extraordinary efforts of the USSR. And the five-year period were not designed for the rise of well-being. Moreover, the famine of 1932 - 1933. Killed millions of people, desolated village, town buildings and renewed cheap labor. "Shakhty case" in the Donbas - the trial of older coal industry experts - organized persecution launched specialists in pre-revolutionary diplomas.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks did not give due importance to financial incentives work. Card system enabled workers and employees to purchase a minimum of goods. Ignoring the economic levers rise in labor productivity, the leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the government tried to use the enthusiasm of the masses, as well as unpaid labor of millions of innocent prisoners. Socialist competition (Stakhanov movement, etc.) Will become the main form of struggle for higher levels of work.</p>
<p>Provided for in the Bolshevik plans displacement of capitalist elements resulted in the physical destruction of large parts of the economically active population - the so-called "kulaks" in the village and owners of private enterprises in the city. Increased trade famine for the efforts in the field of heavy industry were accompanied by a chronic decline of social services, and manufacturing. To keep the pace of industrial development, workers and engineering workers actually attached to enterprises and institutions, and misconduct equated to a criminal offense.</p>
<p>Thus, the positive outcome of the industrialization of Ukraine was the growth of heavy industry (almost 11 times), construction of new mines, power plants and the transformation of Ukraine into an industrial-agrarian country that the level of individual industries ahead of some European states. Adverse effects: disruption of agriculture, light and food industries; irrational and unequal distribution of productive forces; increased centralization of industry; ignoring the economic mechanisms of economic development; decline in living standards (distribution of government loans, sale of alcoholic beverages, queues, ration cards, a chronic shortage of goods and services, housing problems, etc.).</p>
<p>The Soviet leadership, taking the modernization of the industrial potential of the country immediately faced with three problems: money, materials and manpower for the development of the industry. Get all you can from the peasantry, which made up the vast majority of the population. However, the farmer-owner was uncomfortable and unwelcome figure for the party-state apparatus, on behalf of the people disposed industry. The state could not provide the accelerated pace of industrialization, when dealing with millions of individual farmers. With a minimum of capital goods, it had depended on government agencies. As long as the farmer himself decided that he was to sow and to drive the market, it depended on the state, which had to feed the city and the army. Therefore, under the pretext of concern for the welfare of the rural population rise of the party wanted to create a controlled village collective economy.</p>
<p>But Stalin's collectivization plan - is not only a convenient way to ensure the urban population and the army with food, and industry - raw materials and labor. In addition, it was believed to contribute to the social base of the dictatorship of the proletariat on the one hand, encouraged collectivization process of proletarianization of the peasantry (the processes of dispossession and rozselyanyuvannya) on the other - along with industrialization it opened the way for the elimination of stratification in the economy.</p>
<p>The first five-year plan provided that Ukraine will be merged into collective farms 30% of farms. But at the November 1929 Plenum of the CPSU (b) embarked on a continuous accelerated collectivization. The secretary of the CC CP (b) U S. Kosior supported the proposal of complete collectivization in one year. Resolution Plenum "On Ukraine's agriculture and work in the countryside" in Ukraine provided the highest rates of collectivization compared to other Soviet republics. In January 1930 Ukraine attributed to the group of regions where collectivization to be completed in autumn 1931 - spring 1932</p>
<p>In the process of collectivization has several stages: 1929 - 1930 biennium. - A rapid collectivization, turned essentially on communization; collective farms took everything: tools, cattle, horses, poultry, The situation was complicated by excessive efforts of local authorities, on January 20, 1930 in the country was 15.4% collectivized farms, and on March 1 - 62.8%; in many places there were anti-Soviet statements farmers, village plunged into a whirlpool of self-destruction. The peasants began to sell or clog cattle hide or spoil implements. In the 1928-1929 biennium. Ukraine has destroyed 50% of livestock; 1930 - maneuver Stalinist leadership of shifting responsibility to local Party and government bodies (Article Stalin at the beginning of March 1930 "Dizzy with success" or decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU (b) on March 14, 1930 "On combating distortions of the Party line in the collective farm movement"). There was a mass exodus from the farms. In autumn 1930 the collective farms have less than a third of rural households, mainly nezamozhnytskyh, 1931 - 1933 - a new stage of complete collectivization, accelerating its pace, ending mostly collectivization in Ukraine (70% of households collectivized) 1934-1937. - final stage of collectivization. In 1937 96.1% of farms had sown plosch.Vazhlyvym element collectivization was so-called "cannibalization" and actually rozselyanyuvannya village. First, in 1927 - 1928 gg., To wealthy peasants, a policy restriction - increased taxes, limited land lease forbidden to use hired labor, buy cars, tools. In April 1929, Stalin defined a new strategic task - to shift from the policy of restricting the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class. At the end of January 1930 was published ruling CPSU (B) "Measures to eliminate the kulak farms in areas of complete collectivization." Begin mass repression against wealthy peasants and those who did not wish to enter into collective farms. In Ukraine during the years of complete collectivization was expropriated about 200 thousand. Farms (along with their families - 1.2-1.4 million people, of which - 860 thousand. Evicted north of Siberia).</p>
<p>One of the worst crimes of Stalinism against the Ukrainian people was the famine of 1932-1933. Immediately it was the cause of the violent removal of grain from the peasants. However, in reality it has caused a whole set of national political and socio-economic factors: the need to destroy the Ukrainian peasantry as a deliberate national segments that threatened the imperial interests of Moscow, excessive grain procurements for farmers, excessive grain exports, farmers reluctance to work in the public sector, the authorities confiscate food stocks, economic failures, attempt to build a socialist-communist military metodamy.Protyahom January-November 1930, Ukraine has harvested 400 million tons of grain, for the same period in 1931 - 380 million pounds. Withdrawn even seed fund. August 7, 1932 the Central Executive Committee and Sovnarkom adopted a law on the protection of socialist property that for theft of kolkhoz or cooperative ownership predicted execution or imprisonment for not less than 10 years with confiscation of property. The people that draconian document called the "law of five ears."</p>
<p>Despite the unprecedented brutality perform grain procurement plan in 1932 failed. In order to "fix" the situation in Ukraine is sent emergency Bread Procurement Commission headed by Chairman of People's Commissars of the USSR V. Molotov. "Strengthened" User CP (B) - Second Secretary of the Central Committee and secretary of the Kharkov (capital) regional party becomes a personal envoy Stalin Postyshev are carried out reprisals against the Ukrainian Communists. The peasants confiscated now not only corn, but all food.</p>
<p>The exact figure of casualties from famine of 1932 - 1933. Can not be established. Researchers call data from 3.5 to 12 million people.</p>
<p>As a result of the famine had finally broken the resistance of peasants co-feudal system and significantly undermined the original force in defending national rights. Collective farm system was one of the foundations of a command economy and totalitarian regime.</p>
<p>The main result of collectivization was implemented industrial leap for which paid a heavy price: the victims of violent dispossession and famine, loss of farmers a sense of ownership, long-term degradation and disruption of agriculture.</p>
