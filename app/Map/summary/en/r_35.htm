<p>Eurasia stretches across all climatic zones of the northern hemisphere, because it is natural and climatic conditions differ as anywhere else on the planet.</p>
<p>The main reasons for heterogeneity climate is not the same amount of solar radiation that comes to the surface in different parts of Eurasia, as well as various types of atmospheric circulation and extremely varied terrain.</p>
<p>In most of western Eurasia prevailing air mass transfer, which is particularly exacerbated in the winter, when the surface of the Atlantic cyclones dominate Europe. This leads to the fact that winter temperatures of northern and southern regions is not very different among themselves. Summer zonal temperature distribution becomes more noticeable.</p>
<p>Due to the prevailing influence of western air mass transfer and mountainous terrain influence of the Pacific and Indian oceans on climate Eurasia limited to relatively small areas in the east and south. Over the water area of ​​the oceans are formed in the summer field of high pressure that cause movement moist air masses from the oceans to the land. Thus the image of wet and warm summer monsoon, whose influence extends to the southern and south-eastern Asia.</p>
<p>As a result of the weakening influence of western air mass transfer and monsoons in the direction from the coasts to the interior regions, as well as the dominance of this dry continental air masses, the average annual rainfall decreases to promotion to the central regions of the continent. Winter cooling causes the formation of land over the northern and central Asia from November to March area of ​​high pressure - Asian anticyclone. This cold and dry air masses moving in all directions, forming the shores of the Pacific and Indian oceans persistent cold winds (continental winter monsoon).</p>
<p>In general, the huge size of Eurasia is the reason for the prevalence of most types of climate poyasivkontynentalnyh climate. Although in general, for the continental climate characterized by large amplitude variations in temperature and low rainfall, there are significant differences both within the same climatic zone, and between different zones of temperature and moisture. Thus, for mild - moderate continental climate zone characterized relatively cold winters and warm summers. In the interior of Eurasia continental climate change (temperate) and continental (subarctic zone) with little rainfall, warm, sometimes hot summers and harsh winters. Because of the extremely low winter temperatures occur greatest on the planet temperature. Thus, near the town Ojmjakon (Russia), the difference between the absolute maximum and absolute minimum temperature is 103 ° C.</p>
<p>Continental climate is tropical and subtropical zones characterized by hot summers (temperatures in the desert to 52 ° C) and cool winters during which temperatures in mountainous areas often become negative values.</p>
<p>Due to the huge mountain of considerable prevalent on the mainland mountain type climate of extremes in temperature throughout the day.</p>
