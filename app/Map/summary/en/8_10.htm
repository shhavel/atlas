The Danubian principalities and Crimea in terms vassal state of Turkey, on demand of the latter had put his troops. Powerful rebellion and war swept Spain, Italy and Portugal.</p>
<p><b>REASONS OF NATIONAL LIBERATION WAR</b></p>
<p>After the suppression of the Cossack rebellions of the first quarter of the XVII century. increased colonial policy of Poland towards Ukraine as caused an national liberation war.</p>
<p><b>1. The situation of peasants in terms of dominance magnates and corvee-filvarkova economic system:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>rapid enslavement of the peasants;</li>
<li>increasing serfdom and various forms of refining and taxes for the benefit of landowners and the state;</li>
<li>enhance the exploitation of the peasants land lord's tenants.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. Growing discontent Ukrainian bourgeoisie, which suffered both from private owners towns, and from tyranny royal officials:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Orthodox citizens had to settle only in designated neighborhoods;</li>
<li>limited in their classroom craft and trade;</li>
<li>removed from participation in local government, burdened by various taxes and levies.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Restrictions on the Rights of the Cossacks, the introduction of measures aimed at eliminating it as a state:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>with cruelty suppressed any manifestations pokozachennya;</li>
<li>the "ordination ..." all the Cossacks, except 6000th registry - since parts of the Polish army - turned into serfs;</li>
<li>Registered denied the right to vote and Hetman - they had to assign the Polish government from the nobility;</li>
<li>located in Zaporozhye Polish garrison, the castle was rebuilt Kodak;</li>
<li>Cossacks prohibited without the consent of the government to go to the sea and the dry-valley campaign against the Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate. They are obliged to perform all kinds of work, pay onerous taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4. Polonization Ukrainian culture, the forced imposition of Catholicism, which caused mass protests:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Orthodox obligated to pay taxes for the maintenance of the Catholic clergy; they are often forbidden to carry celebration, to occupy certain positions, to create higher education and so on;</li>
<li>Existing closed, forbidden to build new Orthodox churches and monasteries, and their possessions and property confiscated Catholic and Uniate clergy; instead, built churches and the Monastery;</li>
<li>increasing the number of Jesuit colleges, spread their influence;</li>
<li>narrowed the scope of use of the Ukrainian language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the measures that the Polish government was accompanied by his dominance in the Ukrainian lands were to complete their conquest and subjugation, that were colonial. The colonial policy of the Government of the Commonwealth in the middle of the XVII century. exacerbated the situation in Ukraine, causing a nationwide speech.</p>
<p><b>Bogdan Khmelnitsky</b></p>
<p>War of the Ukrainian people against the domination of the Commonwealth led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky.</p>

During the 1646-1647 biennium. Again met with Polish King Wladyslaw IV. During the meeting the right Cossack involvement in hostilities against Poland Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>As the facts show, Bohdan Khmelnytsky had already prepared a rebellion against Poland. To that end, he tried to use the plans of the Polish court on the war against Turkey, in particular voyage Cossacks into the Polish army. On plans Khmelnytsky learned Polish magnates, as evidenced by the events of the personal life of the hetman. Disputes Chygyryns'ka pidstarostoyu Daniel Chaplynka through the estate on Saturday, which he would select, Khmelnytsky led the summer of 1646 in Warsaw. We know that from the King Bogdan received confirmation of their rights to Saturday. However, this did not stop Chaplinsky. In early 1647 he ordered his son was beaten Khmelnitsky in the spring of that year took Chaplinsky Saturday and drove out family Khmelnitsky. So Khmelnytsky on personal experience convinced that tyranny magnates and nobility in the Commonwealth has no limits, and no one but the Cossacks, not protect the rights of the wicked people. So he and his closest associates are actively preparing a rebellion. The intention was discovered, and the fall 1647 Khmelnytsky arrested. In mid-December it with a small detachment of Cossacks and son Timosha went to Zaporozhye.</p>
<p><b>PREPARATION armed uprisings against the Commonwealth</b></p>

</ul>
<p>With the support of Turkey, in February and March 1648 in Bakhchisarai Ukrainian ambassadors made a deal with the Crimean Khan Islam-III Ґireyem military assistance in the war against the Commonwealth.</p>
