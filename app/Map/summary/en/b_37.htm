<p>This card can be used to characterize such global issues as food, health problem, the problem of overcoming the backwardness of the developing countries.</p>
<p>Medical (physiological) normal caloric intake consumed by a person per day is 2 300-2 600 calories and 70-100 grams of protein. If a person does not receive the minimum number of calories, it feels constant hunger with further physical and mental exhaustion. Worldwide, according to WHO, 1.2 billion people starving. A further 2 billion people suffer from hidden hunger, getting malnutrition, which lacks sufficient protein of animal origin (meat, milk), essential vitamins and minerals. This phenomenon is especially characteristic of the countries in the diet of the inhabitants of one dominated by food crops (such as rice, corn or potato). The map shows that the problem of food are citizens of developing countries. In developed countries, the daily food intake is an average of 3300 kcal and a surplus of food. The population of the low level of economic development is not able to satisfy the need for good nutrition. With three times more population of these States have six times the total GDP of less than highly developed countries. Due to illness, hunger and malnutrition, lack of quality drinking water there is a low life expectancy and high mortality. The costs of health care in developing countries, minimum, except Nick and country oil exporters.</p>
<p>One way to solve the food problem and overcoming hunger is Green Revolution that began in some countries in the 60-ies of XX century. Green revolution envisages a set of measures for implementation of high-yielding varieties of cereals, selection, irrigation, chemicals and mechanization of agricultural production. The effectiveness of the Green Revolution has been proven in Asia (India, Thailand, Indonesia, China). These overpopulated countries over the past decade have achieved impressive success in providing food.</p>
