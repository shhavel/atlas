<p>The Soviet Union in the late 1980s</p>
<p>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was formally "single federal multinational state formed on the basis of the principle of socialist federalism as a result of self-determination of nations and the voluntary association of equal Soviet Socialist Republics." There were 15 union republics below them in the Soviet administrative-territorial hierarchies were created based on their nationality Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, of which there were 20 small nations had their own autonomous region (there were 8) and autonomous (10). Multinational administrative units called edges. They were in 1989, there were 6. Contrary to the declared equality, the dominant nation in the state were Russians (they accounted for about half of the total population), the state language - Russian, all important matters are dealt with in Moscow. Cementing force that is confined republic in the Union, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Party structure controlled all aspects of life, especially as the leading role of the Communist Party in Soviet society was enshrined in the Constitution (1977). Since the Constitution guaranteed the right to freely enter the republics of the Union, but de facto - it was impossible to do, and even public discussion of this was considered treason. Therefore, since the Soviet Union was founded in 1922 remained authoritarian centralized state imperial type.</p>
<p>The area of ​​the USSR amounted to 22.4 million km2 - it was the largest country in the world, and the largest population (286.7 million people in 1989), second only to China and India. However vast expanse mastered not the same. The production potential of the state concentrated in its European part. Asia, much of the Soviet Union, was sparsely populated and poorly developed areas. On the seat of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union indicates that 2.7% of the population of 18% of the total population (51.7 million people). Ukraine gave a quarter of all EU agricultural products, more than 17% of industrial output, including 40% of all Soviet steel, 34% coal, 52% iron, as a whole - 20% of the total national income of the USSR. At the same time Ukraine has contributed to the Union budget by 10% more than got out of it. If the economic potential of Ukraine was second only to Russia, in terms of consumption, it lagged behind the same from Russia and the Baltic republics. Wages in the Ukrainian SSR kennel 10% lower than the average for the Union. Thus, by exploiting Ukraine union leadership found funding for priority development of the eastern regions of the country and for other purposes, far from the interests of Ukraine.</p>
