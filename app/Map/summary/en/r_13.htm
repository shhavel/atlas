<p>It is safe to say that the man was traveling throughout her existence. Archaeological excavations indicate that as early as 10 thousand years ago, people sailed the Mediterranean Sea. However, the first written evidence of the long journey down to us from the third millennium BC: Egyptian sailors mastered the sea route to the east coast of Africa and the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Of course, the motives of those trips were different: the discovery and conquest of new lands, acquiring new trade routes, the search for El Dorado, the satisfaction of his own curiosity and more. But certainly the fact that it travels and discoveries were the determining factors of world progress. With each expedition expanded the horizons of knowledge of geography, astronomy and medicine. Discover new lands made it possible for people to exchange goods, technology, cultural achievements, enriching each other. However, it happened so, that new discoveries aliens were destroyed or absorbed by whole nations with their unique culture.</p>
<p>Most expeditions were oceans and seas. Due to the imperfection of vehicles in the past (canoe, pies, sailing), it is remarkable courage and endurance, such as Norman, dating back to the verge of the first and second millennia BC overcame the cold waters of the North Atlantic giant distance.</p>
<p>It is hardly possible to mention all noble and simple travelers who value their health or even life opened for us the oceans and seas, continents, islands, straits. And there are figures, the achievement of which can be considered a turning point in the history of mankind: Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, James Cook, Roald Amundsen. It was after the expeditions of these people was changing dramatically understanding of the Earth or some of its regions, and humanity out a new level of development.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the most prominent figures in world history was Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p>This person through perseverance and the courage not only able to overcome the difficulties she endured while traveling, but also to endure accusations of wasting money on aimless wandering. The result of his four expeditions was the discovery of the New World (America), although the Columbus before his death, believed that discovered the shortest route to India. Paradoxically, the hero spent his last years in wanderings and died in poverty. Only after the death of explorer humanity appreciated his feat. Although the results of his discoveries were not only positive: the colonizers viewed the new land primarily as an object of enrichment were taken a lot of gold and other valuables were destroyed indigenous culture, thousands of people were sold into slavery. Yet Columbian can be put on a par with the greatest achievements of mankind, such as space flight, the invention of drugs for fatal diseases, conquer the deep sea and more.</p>
