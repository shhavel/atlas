<p>Antin Zhdanovich - Ukrainian military leader, diplomat. In 1649 Kiev became a colonel. 1651 participated in the defense of Kyiv Lithuanian forces. We perform diplomatic missions in Turkey, Poland and Muscovy. 1656-1657 biennium. Commanded the army, sent to help Khmelnytskyi Transylvanian Prince Yuri (Dyerdyu) II Rákóczi against Poland.

<p><b>NOTE!</b></p>
<p>Pereyaslav Council in 1654 did not represent the point of view of most of the population Ukrainian (it generally attended by about 200 people), the oath is Tsar Alexei I (just king, not Russia or the Russian people!) Was given to a small number of people Hetman, often on pain of reprisals or same with the deliberate violation of the oath formula. It is worth mentioning that the referendum did not exist, that even to participate in the discussion of these problems has been removed peasantry, which constituted the majority of the population. (Of course, at that time, in solving these problems did not participate and women). Orthodox clergy refused to take the oath as well as the Zaporizhzhya Sich. Consequently, only the population of the Hetmanate (Cossacks with the gentry and burgesses), and not the whole, gave the oath. We know that to participate in the oath dodged several regiments, prominent figures of the National Liberation War (I.Bohun, Y.Hluh, H.Hulyanytskyy, I. Sirko et al.). It is worth noting that the oath and geographically covers only Dnieper.</p>
<p>The text of the agreement in 1654 in the usual modern diplomatic practice as never existed. The specificity of the contract was that it placed three representatives (not all!) Of states, each separately. Ukrainian Orthodox clergy refused after contract; tradesmen satisfied confirmation of their rights and liberties granted by Polish kings and Grand Dukes of Lithuania, and the so-called "March Articles" concluded the actual Cossack delegation, agreement was reached on 17 articles (23). Of the six important articles parties fail to reach agreement, a number of important points in Ukrainian-Russian relations in general were not reflected in the contract of 1654 In general, historians agree that the contract was incomplete and imperfect, but an equal and mutually beneficial. Acted, however, it is very short time and already in 1656 was grossly violated Moscow (Truce of Vilna). Because of this, the Ukrainian government signed a military alliance with Sweden and Transylvania in 1656 and in 1658 broke the pact signing Hadiach finally Ukrainian-Russian agreement in 1654 was later launched the Russian-Ukrainian war of 1658-1659 years., Which lost to Ukraine and its government was forced to sign the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1659, this time unequal, which put an end to the national independence. (Yu.A.Mytsyk).</p>
<p><b>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UKRAINIAN STATE and Muscovy</b></p>
<p>From the end of 1648 between Muscovy Hetmanate and began a constant exchange of embassies.</p>
<p>Hetman government concerned about the possibility of establishing relations with the Commonwealth of Muscovy. It connected them Polyanivskyy peace treaty in 1634 that the king did not dare to break so as not to give the Polish government about a new war.</p>
<p>At the same time Moscow was ready to assist the Commonwealth, the evidence which led to the transfer of large military units on the Moscow-Ukrainian border. In Moscow, waiting until both sides Ukrainian-Polish war znesylyatsya and flame mark Cossack uprising that could spread to Moscow lands.</p>
<p>To push the royal government to the union of the Cossack Army, Khmelnitsky in June 1653 made it clear to the king, if he continue zvolikatyme solution of Ukrainian question, then Ukraine will enter into an alliance with Turkey. Moreover Hetman said in a very unpleasant consequences of such a union to Muscovy.</p>
<p>October 1, 1653 Moscow Zemsky Sobor decided: "... Bohdan Khmelnytsky all Zaporozhian Host cities and land take" and go to war against Poland. In connection with the decision of Zemsky Sobor was sent to Ukraine a large embassy led by boyar Basil Buturlin. Meetings and negotiations, presentation of the Tsar and watches KLEYNOD held in the council Pereyaslav January 8, 1654</p>
<p><b>Ukrainian-Muscovite interstate agreement in 1654</b></p>
<p>Pereyaslav Council launched a design Moskovka-Ukrainian relations, since no written agreements in Pereyaslav was signed. Everything had to decide negotiations.</p>
<p>As a researcher discovered the day Cossack Yuri Mytsyk peculiarity of Ukrainian-Moscow Treaty was that it was a group of documents from each of the states - though specific arrangements of the clergy, bourgeoisie, the Cossacks.</p>
<p>Cossack agreement consisted of 23 papers on behalf of the hetman and the Zaporozhian Host. The basic idea of ​​these articles - the establishment of international relations in which Ukraine will remain both internally and externally independent. It is with these floors Ukrainian delegation arrived in Moscow. The draft Ukrainian envoys gave the Moscow government March 14, 1654</p>
<p>Because weekly draft treaty negotiations with the Cossacks little changed, agreed on 17 articles and six very important coordination postponed to a later date. According to the March articles (so-called coordinated 17 articles):</p>
<p>Cossack Hetman and the rulers were chosen on the board.</p>
<p>Ukrainian court administration and remained independent and not subordinate to Moscow.</p>
<p>Tax collection was entrusted to the Ukrainian Military treasure.</p>
<p>Number Cossack Host was set at 60 thousand. People.</p>
<p>Ukrainian burgesses had to keep all their rights and liberties that they were no data Lithuanian Polish kings and princes, especially municipality.</p>
<p>Lengthy negotiations Orthodox clergy had no results. Ukrainian Orthodox Church did not agree to the dependence of the Patriarch of Moscow, which sought the Moscow government and the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>So just burgers general understanding of the Moscow government, the Cossacks with the Ukrainian Orthodox nobility - only partially, and Orthodox clergy abandoned the illegal demands of Moscow.</p>
<p>Documents signed during the Moscow-Ukrainian talks in 1654, to establish interstate relations that do not restrict the independence of Ukraine. Terms of Ukrainian-Moscow Treaty in 1654 indicate a unification of Ukraine and Muscovy in fact a kind of confederation treaty between the two countries was generally equal and (subject) mutually beneficial. However, it was unfinished, imperfect, operated for a short time (several years) and soon it violated his Russian side is actually invalid.</p>
<p><b>The value of Ukrainian-Muscovite contract in 1654</b></p>
<p>Despite the imperfections and fragility, Ukrainian-Moscow Treaty in 1654 during the XVII - XVIII centuries. regarded as the most convincing proof of Ukrainian sovereignty of Ukraine.</p>
<p>It made it possible to fully preserve the independence of the newly established Ukrainian Hetman State.</p>
<p>Ukrainian government was able to bring the war to the finish against the Commonwealth, and thus complete the reunification of all Ukrainian lands under his rule.</p>
<p>In international relations, the agreement reaffirmed Ukraine's right to secede from Poland.</p>
<p>Agreement was also an expression of international recognition of independence of the Ukrainian state immunity established system of social and economic relations.</p>
<p><b>Course of hostilities against Poland in the 1654-1655 biennium.</b></p>
<p>Soon in Belarus and Smolensk opened hostilities. In the western campaign army were sent to Moscow Tsar and Bohdan Khmelnytsky 20000th Army Cossacks led by Colonel John Nizhyn Zolotarenko.</p>
<p>For Moscow-allied Ukrainian troops at the campaign was successful. In the summer of 1655 they drove the Lithuanian army from Belarus and Lithuania took the part with the capital Vilnius.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1654, military operations began in the territory of Ukraine. In mid-November 30000th Polish army vderlasya to Bratslavshchina. The campaign lasted until the spring of 1655 his result was devastation skirts, mid-February was destroyed nearly 50 cities.</p>
<p>In December 1654 the Polish army combined with the 30,000th Tatar horde, January 15, came to Uman and surrounded her. To help Ivan Bohun, who led the defense of Uman went Khmelnytsky Cossack units and 10-12-thousand Muscovite army. This forced the Polish-Tatar command to lift the siege and return the army to meet the Ukrainian-Muscovite forces.</p>
<p>January 19, 1655 Polish-Tatar army surrounded the Ukrainian-Muscovite camp near the village Ohmatovym (now in Cherkasy region.). The siege lasted for several days and exhausted rivals. Particularly plagued by frost. Contemporaries called the place of battle "field tremors" or Dryzhypolem, and the battle of Ohmatovym - Dryzhypilskoyu battle.</p>
<p>Battle of Ochmatów ended with a slight advantage Ukrainian troops, but Bohdan Khmelnytsky was able to strike a decisive blow Polish-Tatar army and the release of her territory Bratslavshchina.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1655 Khmelnytsky traveled with army skirts through to Galicia. The aim of the campaign was free from Polish domination western lands and unite Ukraine in its ethnic borders. In early August, the army halted near Kamenets-Podolsk.</p>
<p>During the siege, the city adopted a hetman of the Swedish ambassador. He said the accession of Sweden July 9 in the war against Poland. Khmelnitsky, for his part, promised military assistance to the Swedish king.</p>
<p>September 19, 1655 Ukrainian army utterly defeated the Polish army crown hetman Stanislaw Potocki at small towns, which is 25 km from the city. As a result of the victory was released a significant part of Western Ukraine.</p>
<p>The same day the Ukrainian army approached the city and surrounded it. Realizing that the assault would cause severe losses not only residents, but also the military, Bohdan Khmelnytsky agreed to talks with the Lviv authorities. Soon Hetman received redemption and retreated from the city.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Lake District town of November 12, 1655 agreement was reached between the hetman and the Crimean khan. Including an interference Crimea in Ukraine and Muscovy war against Poland. The agreement made it possible to avoid the Tatar attack on Moscow and Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>Thus, despite the complexity of the situation, the summer-autumn campaign in 1655 for the Ukrainian-Muscovite forces in Ukraine ended successfully.</p>
<p><b>Vilna to Moscow-Polish armistice in 1656</b></p>
<p>At the end of 1655th the first half of 1656 Bohdan Khmelnytsky led an extremely active diplomatic activity exchanged embassies with Swedish and Polish kings, the Crimean khan, Moldovan owner and Transylvanian prince.</p>
<p>However, the government of Tsar Alexis frightened military successes of Swedish troops in Poland (Sweden conquered almost all of Poland), began active preparations for war against Sweden.</p>
<p>Polish diplomats, seeking salvation for the country, offered the Polish crown on the death of John II Casimir Alexis. This proposal also prompted Moscow for talks with Warsaw, which ended October 24, 1656 Truce of Vilna.</p>
<ul>
<li>Behind him hostilities between the Commonwealth and Moscow stopped;</li>
<li>both countries have pledged not to start peace negotiations with Sweden;</li>
<li>instead assumed to joint military action against Sweden and Brandenburg;</li>
<li>elected king of the Polish throne.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ukrainian delegation to participate in the Vilna talks in Moscow diplomats are not allowed, and offers B.Khmelnytskyi on the position of negotiating ignored that very angered and Cossacks hetman.</p>
<p><b>CHANGE foreign policy orientation Bogdan Khmelnitsky</b></p>
<p>Vilna to Moscow-Polish armistice in the Hetman's capital was perceived as a flagrant violation of the treaty in 1654, in fact, as a betrayal by the king. Getman decided to seek new allies against Poland.</p>
<p>Transylvania was a real contender and Sweden.</p>
<p>Relations with Transylvania Khmelnitsky has established in 1648, however, they were not equal: so allied, then strained, as happened after an unsuccessful campaign Timosha Khmelnitsky in Moldavia in autumn 1653</p>
<p>October 8, 1656 between the Cossack Army and Transylvania signed an agreement on military alliance against the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Transylvanian Prince George (Dyerd) II Rákóczi promised to help win Khmelnytsky Galicia and part of Belarus recognized the hetman title of Prince and maintained its intention to transfer the title to his son Yuri.</p>
<p>Diplomatic relations with Sweden Bohdan Khmelnytsky started in 1652 and maintained thereafter. In September 1655, when the outbreak of the Polish-Swedish War, Khmelnytsky offered to the Swedish king Carl-Gustaf alliance against Poland on condition that all the n (Ukrainian) lands of the Commonwealth will be given to Ukraine.</p>
<p>In 1656 Ukraine relations with Sweden have become regular, but the Swedes did not want to give Ukrainian lands were in Poland, because they themselves claim.</p>
<p>In January 1657 the Swedish ambassador brought a draft treaties of alliance, but only with the recognition of the state of the Cossack territory (Dnieper). Khmelnitsky released from the contract.</p>
<p>In June Chyhyryn newly arrived Swedish embassy. It is reported that King Carl Gustaf Ukrainian Hetman agrees to give land under Poland, Belarus and part of Smolensk, earth itself is left Poland.</p>
<p>In December 1656 Yuri (Dyerd) II Rákóczi signed with the Swedish King treatise "perpetual union". Now, if mutual hostilities Ukraine and Transylvania could hope for assistance from Sweden, which, having no contractual relationship with the Hetman's government would support transylvantsiv.</p>
<p><b>OF UKRAINIAN troops in Galicia and Poland in the 1656-1657 biennium.</b></p>
<p>When in December 1656 launched an offensive Transylvanian Prince George (Dyerdya) II Rákóczi Poland, Khmelnytsky sent to his aid Cossack regiments, headed by Colonel Anton Zhdanovich Kiev.</p>
<p>At first Ukrainian-Swedish-Transylvanian army operated successfully, gaining Przemysl, Warsaw, Cracow, Lublin, Brest.</p>
<p>However, from mid-May his situation worsened. Failures repeatedly harassed allies.</p>
<p>After the attack of Denmark to Sweden Swedish King George Rakoczy left.</p>
<p>Became strained relationship with Prince Cossacks.</p>
<p>On learning about the invasion of Polish troops in Transylvania, George Rakoczy, despite the fact that it was taken Warsaw, began negotiations with the Poles.</p>
<p>11-12 July 1657, received the news of the approach of the Tartar hordes that would cut it way back, and finally lost hope for a successful conclusion of the struggle against Poland, Transylvanian prince surrendered.</p>
<p>The Cossacks learned about the intentions of George Rakoczy eve of surrender and, fearing that he will give them Poles, were departed from him.</p>
<p><b>Bogdan Khmelnitsky - politicians, diplomats, military leader</b></p>
<p>The campaign against Poland did not bring final victory over the Commonwealth. When news of the unauthorized return Zhdanovicha to Ukraine came to the hetman, this caused him a fatal blow. July 27, 1657 Ukrainian hetman died.</p>
<p>When determining where to Bogdan Khmelnitsky in Ukrainian history, the researchers emphasize that the main achievement of his work was the revival of Ukrainian state. It was the restoration of an independent state that would unite all ethnic Ukrainian lands and would be the successor of Kievan Rus, Hetman saw the results he headed the National Liberation War. Therefore, nation-building, formation of all its parts occurred under his personal supervision.</p>
<p>In the hands of Hetman focused legislative, executive and judicial power. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>called the General and the Council of Officers;</li>
<li>was chief of the armed forces;</li>
<li>published universals;</li>
<li>participated in the proceedings (acting hetman of the military court);</li>
<li>took care of finances;</li>
<li>by the Board started the war;</li>
<li>led peace talks;</li>
<li>led diplomatic relations with other states and Intelligence Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Efforts Bohdan Khmelnytsky during the first year of the war with scattered peasant and Cossack units were created one of the strongest armies in Europe at that time. People's Liberation Army had more than 100,000 Cossacks and was organized by the regimental-sotnia territorial principle: certain territory exhibited several hundred Cossacks, who rallied the regiment.</p>
<p>Bohdan Khmelnytsky drew the Cossack army of highly generals. They were from different social classes, but all united extraordinary commitment to the National Liberation War and personally Khmelnytsky. The closest entourage were hetman Philo Jalali, Theodore Veshnyaki John kettlebell, Nestorenko Maxim, Maxim Kryvonis, Tymish Nosach brothers Vyhovskyy Nechay, Zolotarenko, Hulyanytski, Stanislav, Mikhail Krichevsky, Ivan Bohun, Ostap Gogol, Anton Zhdanovich, Martin Nebaba.</p>
<p>From the first months of the national liberation war Bohdan Khmelnytsky proved himself as a talented diplomat. His diplomatic activity aimed at strengthening the international position of the Cossack Ukraine.</p>
<p>Owes Bohdan Khmelnytsky was the fact that, despite the different class interests, the Ukrainian people spoke only force in the struggle for national liberation.</p>
