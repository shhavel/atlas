<p>Australia, the smallest continent of the Earth, located in the eastern part of the southern hemisphere. Its area of ​​the islands is 7687 thousand in km. Sq.</p>
<p>Australia is washed by the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Near the northeastern coast it is the largest coral formation in the world, the famous Great Barrier Reef, which stretches more than 2000 km and has a width of 150 km.</p>
<p>The height of the mainland at least 300 m, maximum - G. Kosciuszko (2228 m), the lowest - level of Lake Eyre (-16 m above sea level). To the west of the continent is Western Plateau, which formed in Precambrian platform. To the east of the plateau - the structure of a younger Paleozoic platform, parts of which were formed in the era of Baikal, and hertsynskoyi Caledonian folding. At the heart of the Central Lowlands - Paleozoic plate covered platform cover. Great Dividing Range is the result horoutvoryuvalnyh processes era and hertsynskoyi Caledonian folding. In the south, the Central Lowlands is a mountain rises, which was formed in the era of Baikal folding. In the south-east of Great Dividing Range is called the Australian Alps through scenic landscapes and a certain resemblance to the European Alps.</p>
<p>Much of the continent is desert. The river system is poorly developed. Almost 60% of the continent - a stagnant region where stretch a dry riverbed - Creek, which filled with water only after infrequent rains.</p>
<p>The largest in Australia for long - p. Darling (2740 km), deepest - p. Murray (2570 km). The south-western part of Australia - a land of small lakes (the largest - Ayr), but they all salty. Therefore, great importance is considerable reserves of available groundwater. On the mainland there are no young high mountains, so there are no volcanoes and modern glaciation.</p>
<p>Australia almost equally dividing line of the Southern Tropic. Therefore, it is very warm and arid continent. On his influence, along with other factors, the heat flow. In warm water coral reefs are formed (Timorske, Arafura, Coral Sea). The southern coast of the continent cooled currents westerly winds and south-west - the stream that is formed near Antarctica.</p>
