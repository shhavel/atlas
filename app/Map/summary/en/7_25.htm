<p><b>1. Crimea and Black Sea</b></p>
<p>Before the Mongol invasion of the Black Sea steppes belonged Kuman.</p>
<p>Conquered them, the Mongol khans Polovtsian land attached to their immediate possessions.</p>
<p><b>The emergence of the Crimean Khanate</b></p>
<p>In the 15 th century. with the intensification of the struggle for power in the Golden Horde rulers Crimean ulus - they called this part of the Golden Horde khans of their possessions - and began to seek a one-man rule. Fate smiled Haji Giray, which was in 1449 declared himself an independent ruler of the Crimean Khanate.</p>
<p>Thus, the Crimean Khanate as an independent feudal state was formed due to the collapse of the Golden Horde and involved the Crimean peninsula, the lower reaches of the Dnieper, Azov and Kuban.</p>
<p>Researchers stress that exercise intentions Khan Hajji Giray could with the support of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas.</p>
<p>But peace did not last long. Already successor Haji Giray, his son Mengli Gil, seeking more power, found itself the other allies, and it was a tragedy for the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p><b>Go Crimean khans a vassal state of Turkey</b></p>
<p>Characteristics of Turkey (Ottoman Empire) in 1475 pidsunulysya directly to the borders of the Crimean Khanate. This happened as a result of the conquest of Turkey Black Sea port cities.</p>
<p>The Ottoman Empire has grown from a small principality and during 14-16 century. conquered many countries on three continents (Asia, Africa and Europe).</p>
<p>Danger of Turkey winning put at risk the lives and development of Europe.</p>
<p>The Turks had almost all Hungary, came close to Vienna and fought against Venice and Spain.</p>
<p>Before the city of the northern coast of the Black Sea belonged to Genoa Italian Republic.</p>
<p>The first Genoese colonies in the northern Black Sea coast was Kafa (Feodosia), where the Genoese settled in the second half of the 13th century.</p>
<p>In 1357 the Genoese seized Cembalo (Balaklava), 1365 - Soldayya (Surozh now Pike), southern and eastern coast of the Crimea, where later, a new colony of Genoese Bosporus (on the site of modern Kerch).</p>
<p>They also established themselves at the mouth of the Don (colony Tana) and the Caucasus. Genoese colony of Northern Black Sea were subject to Kaffa.</p>
<p>The Turkish sultan was received in 1475 and created a port city on the northern coast of the Black Sea its province (Eyalet) from the center of Kaffa.</p>
<p>In addition to the value of trade centers, captured the city was interested in the Turkish government as an important military facilities, and each city according to the custom of those times was a mighty fortress.</p>
<p>Turkish sultan ordered every way to increase their military power. To the city rushed to deploy the Turkish military garrison. In addition, laid and new castle.</p>
<p>Considering the military might of the Turkish sultan, Mengli Giray in 1478 preferred to be his vassal.</p>
<p>This shift in foreign policy orientations of the Crimean Khanate resulted in devastating hordes of predatory raids of Crimean Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p><b>Start of predatory wars of Ukrainian lands</b></p>
<p><b>The fate of Ukrainian slaves</b></p>
<p>The first major campaign against the Ukraine Khan Mengli Gil made in 1482</p>
<p>Then Kyiv was burned, and his church robbed.</p>
<p>In captivity got a lot of people could not escape himself Kyiv governor and his family.</p>
<p>From 1482 Tatar campaign held annually or even twice - three times a year.</p>
<p>Horde, the Crimean Khan devastated skirts, Kyiv, Volyn, Kholmshchyna and Galicia and Ukrainian people have terrible consequences.</p>
<p>Ordyntsi plundered and destroyed everything in its path, leaving behind a wasteland.</p>
<p>Men, women, boys and girls were taken prisoner, and those who resisted were killed.</p>
<p>Yasser arrives at slave markets in the cities of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Once in slavery, slaves were doomed</p>
<p>Most of them waited exhausting work on excavation and construction.</p>
<p>Men usually become hrebtsyamy the Turkish galley-prison. Women and girls fall into harems.</p>
<p>Adolescent boys handed over to the Sultan Guard, where they raised Janissaries.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 16th century. of the Crimean Khanate included Nogai Horde. They were a powerful force of predatory campaigns.</p>
<p>Activities of the Lithuanian government to protect Ukrainian lands</p>
<p>The Lithuanian government has tried to organize the defense of its southern possessions. Border Protection took over the border was old and big tycoons.</p>
<p>Chronicles of the 16th century. among the organizers resist the horde called Duke Constantine Ostrog, which is more than 60 times fought against the Crimean Tatars, including in 1512 when Vyshnevtsem in Volyn and 1527 in the district. Krekhiv in Kiev.</p>
<p>Ostrog freed from captivity thousands of prisoners.</p>
<p>However, small detachments Boyar guards could not effectively oppose the Tartar hordes.</p>
<p>Urgent need of strengthening locks, located in Kanev, Cherkassy, ​​Zvenigorod, Vinnitsa, Bratslav.</p>
<p>Local gentry had neither the means nor the human forces to conduct major operations.</p>
<p>There was no hope that the state nearly exhausted Hundred Years' War against Muscovy, for danger.</p>
<p>Devastating raids, Tatar Nogai hordes showed complete failure ancient defense system of the southern border.</p>
<p><b>2. Transcarpathian region of Hungary</b></p>
<p>It has long been inhabited by Slavic tribes Transcarpathia was originally closely related to the Kievan Rus.</p>
<p>However, in the early 11th century. After the death of Vladimir the Great, it came under the rule of the Hungarian nobles, who, however, failed to gain a foothold in the region only in the 13th century.</p>
<p>In the late 14th century. Transcarpathian lands are among the interests of the Lithuanian princes, but the supreme power belonged to the Hungarian king.</p>
<p>One of the descendants Gedimin - Theodore Koriatovich who ruled on the tail, due to the difficult political situation in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania has transferred its rights of Hungarian kings, for which he received land in Transcarpathia.</p>
<p>Theodore Koriatovich much cared for cultural, economic and national development of the region.</p>
<p>In his ruling on Chernecha Mountain at Mukachevo was founded monastery of the library, which was destined for a long time to be a major cultural and educational center in Transcarpathia.</p>
<p><b>In 1526, after the defeat of the Hungarian army against the Turks in the Battle Mohachem, Transcarpathia was divided between the Principality of Transylvania (a vassal of Turkey) and the Holy Roman Empire, which was ruled by emperors of the Austrian Habsburg dynasty.</b></p>
<p><b>3. Bukovina as part of Moldavia</b></p>
<p>Bukovina land was part of Kievan Rus from the second half of the 11th century.</p>
<p>With the demise of the Galicia-Volyn principality part of Bukovina fell under the rule of Moldavian princes.</p>
<p>End of the 14th - the first half of the 15th century. territory of Bukovina was redistributed into several districts (counties).</p>
<p>Parish led by elders who originally belonged to the Ukrainian probably the local nobility.</p>
<p>During the 1387-1497 biennium. Moldova recognized the supremacy of Poland.</p>
<p>From the 70s of the 15th century. through the Tatar-Turkish attack position Bukovynian lands under the authority of the Moldavian princes began to fail.</p>
<p>The then ruler of Moldavia, Stefan III (1457-1504 gg.) Hoping for assistance from Poland.</p>
<p>However, the Polish king did not provide troops to protect the possessions of Stephen III, as the Moldavian master was forced in 1486 to conclude a peace treaty with Turkey.</p>
<p>According to this Moldavian principality was required to pay an annual tribute to the Turkish sultan of 5 thousand. Gold.</p>
<p>These funds are collected from the peasants, which caused their protests. To somehow save the situation, the Moldovan rulers decided to direct their anger against Poland.</p>
<p>The Polish government was accused that he had not fulfilled its obligations to the Principality and did not protect him from attacks in Turkey, then the means to pay tribute was allowed to acquire the neighboring Polish dominions.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1490 a detachment of 9 thousand. Armed peasants, led by an experienced warrior named Fly approached Bukovyna-Galician border.</p>
<p>In August of this army quickly captured the Galician city Snyatin, Coloma and Galich, robbing many estates.</p>
<p>Some prey were sent to Bukovina.</p>
<p>Detachments Flies supported Galician peasantry and of the nobility.</p>
<p>On this basis, the researchers concluded that a peasant uprisings began to pick up the character of social and national liberation struggle of Ukrainian people against Polish oppression.</p>
<p>In September 1490 peasant army crossed the Dniester and moved to Rohatyn.</p>
<p>However, the battle that took place here was not successful for the rebels. Farmers suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Fly and other leaders, and 600 rebels were captured and soon nearly all were executed.</p>
<p>However, did not stop the massacre of peasants.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1491 they renewed their attacks on Polish possessions. Now their leader was Andrew Bahrul.</p>
<p>The troops occupied all Bahrul Pokuttya, but their campaign was suppressed. Some of Bukovina attacks on Polish peasants and estates occurred in 1492</p>
<p>As a result of the events in the second half of 1497 against Moldova was organized by the great Polish campaign.</p>
<p>However, the success he achieved. In response to the spring 1498 Stephan III simultaneously with the Turks and Tatars devastated Galicia and Podolia and occupied Pokuttya.</p>
<p>King of Poland did not want to put up with the loss Pokuttya. So the struggle for land continued.</p>
<p>In 1509 the Polish army knocked out Moldovans Pokuttya devastated and burned Bukovina Chernivtsi.</p>
<p><b>Simultaneously, the Moldovan principality intensified pressure from Turkey, which ultimately led to its conquest in 1538, and therefore Bukovina fell under the rule of the Ottoman Empire and its proxies.</b></p>
<p><b>4. Moscow-Lithuanian War, late 15th - early 16th century.</b></p>
<p>During the second half of the 15th century. Muscovy became a powerful state.</p>
<p>Under the rule of Ivan III were united all North n the ground. Young powers sought new territories.</p>
<p>So from the 80's. 15 in. started the war between Muscovy and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</p>
<p>Formally, the result has not been announced, but the border conflicts on the edge of the Muscovite-Lithuanian continued through the whole of the penultimate decade of the 15th century., Which gave researchers reason to call these events "phony war."</p>
<p>Wars and armed conflicts not abated, and during the first decades of the 16th century.</p>
<p>In the early 16th century. several small feudal princes Sivershchyna voluntarily gave themselves under the authority of State Ivan III, but most ended up as part of Muscovy as a result of armed confrontations.</p>
<p>So as a result of military operations 1500 - 1503 gg. To state John III moved all siverian city, in particular, Chernigov, Starodub Putyvl, Rilsk, Novgorod-Seversky, Liubech.</p>
<p>Consistently putting an aggressive policy, the Moscow government in 1507 unleashed a new war against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</p>
<p>During the campaign in 1514 Muscovite army captured Smolensk and Belarus moved at Orsha - an important strategic point at the intersection of trade routes between Kyiv, Minsk, Vilnius and Moscow.</p>
<p>Towards the Muscovites departed 30,000th Ukrainian-Belarusian-Lithuanian army led by Prince Constantine Ostrog.</p>
<p>From 80 ths. Muscovite army was cavalry.</p>
<p>However, Prince Constantine acted decisively and judiciously. He resorted to military tricks: zimituvavshy retreat and Muscovites having got trapped under his volley artillery commander won a convincing victory.</p>
<p>It happened on September 8, 1514</p>
<p><b>Historians appreciate the significance of the Battle of Orsha.</b></p>
<p>After all, the extremely complex historical moment saved territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The victory lifted the morale of the oppressed previous defeats the soldiers and crossed the opportunity Muscovite alliance with European countries.</p>
<p>However, the victory did not put an end to confrontation Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Muscovy for Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p><b>By 1537 the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the wars against Muscovy gradually lost nearly a third of its territory, including Chernihiv-Sivershchyna and Smolensk.</b></p>
