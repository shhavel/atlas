<p><b>FIGHT Hetman Petro Doroshenko ASSOCIATION OF UKRAINE</b></p>
<p>Hetmanship Peter Doroshenko on the Right Bank (1665-1676) began under extremely difficult circumstances. Cossack Ukraine was divided into two Hetman. Particularly appalling devastation suffered Right Bank, where as a result of war and civil war had destroyed 65-70% of the population.</p>
<p>Doroshenko first resorted to measures aimed at improving the internal situation.</p>
<p>Strenuous encouraged settlement devastated southern right bank. Consistently defended the interests of the Cossack.</p>
<p>To get rid of dependence Hetman of officers sought to introduce a lifetime hetman's power.</p>
<p>He created a standing army, which numbered about 20 thousand. Serdyuks.</p>
<p>Great spiritual support to the hetman coming to Chygyryn Orthodox Metropolitan of Kiev Joseph Nelyubovych-Tukals'kyy.</p>
<p>The main purpose of our own Peter Doroshenko saw in consolidating his power on the Right Bank and the gradual unification of all Ukrainian lands into one state.</p>
<p>This led to a war between the Commonwealth and the Ukraine.</p>
<p>In February 1666 Council officers supported the political agenda advanced by Doroshenko. It was agreed:</p>
<ul>
<li>expel Poles from Ukraine;</li>
<li>an alliance with the Crimean khan;</li>
<li>speak on the Left Bank to merge it with the right bank under the authority of a hetman - Doroshenko.</li>
</ul>
<p>In December 1666 together with detachments Doroshenko Tatars destroyed the 6000th unit under Polish Braylov Bratslavshchina. However, a successful performance does not put an end to discord in Ukraine, but only suppressed its divisions.</p>
<p>The news of the signing of Muscovy and Poland Andrusovo contract painfully struck right-bank hetman and urged him to resume hostilities against Poland.</p>
<p><b>PROCLAMATION Hetman Petro Doroshenko whole UKRAINE</b></p>
<p>At the beginning of 1668 for petty Board Chyhyryn bank hetman again raised the issue of unification Hetman, this time under the protection of Turkey.</p>
<p>The same decision was made to board the Left.</p>
<p>Left-bank Ukraine and captured Slobidska antymoskovske uprising. Interestingly, headed Bryukhovetsky, who tried in this way to retain power.</p>
<p>In early March 1668 Moscow garrison was driven out of most cities in the Left Bank. Ivan Sirko cleared of all Muscovites Sloboda Ukraine, except Kharkov.</p>
<p>This prompted Doroshenko crusade with the hope of reuniting Ukrainian lands. In June 1668 he crossed the Dnieper and went up to meet Bryuhovetskomu.</p>
<p>June 8 in the camp under Opishnae that in Poltava Cossacks did revolt, killed Briukhovetsky and elected hetman Doroshenko both sides Dnipra.Schob in control of the Left, Doroshenko arranged in major cities of their garrison. All of Ukraine in his hands.</p>
<p>However, to consolidate the power of the newly elected Hetman of the Left is not lucky.</p>
<p>The north threatened to Muscovy.</p>
<p>The event went on the offensive forces of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Cossacks put forward his nominee to mace - nephew Peter Briukhovetsky winds.</p>
<p>This made the direction back to the right bank.</p>
<p>On the left side of the Dnieper acting hetman remained Chernihiv colonel Damian sinful.</p>
<p><b>Hetman Damian Mnohohrishny (1669-1672 gg.)</b></p>
<p>Talks about the election Mnohohrishny Left Bank Hetman continued throughout autumn 1668</p>
<p>Mnohohrishny eventually agreed to return under the supremacy of the king provided a key to Moscow's withdrawal of Ukrainian cities.</p>
<p>Cossack Ukraine again split into two Hetman.</p>
<p>The talks between Moscow and the government ended conclusion Mnohohrishny Hlukhivsky articles. March 9, 1669 at the General Council of the deaf Mnohohrishny proclaimed the Hetman of Left-bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>For Hlukhivsky articles, consisting of 27 items,</p>
<ul>
<li>Moscow magistrates remained only in five cities, and they had no right to interfere in the affairs of local government;</li>
<li>mounted Cossack register of 30 thousand .;</li>
<li>Hetman was also right to hold auxiliaries - 1 thousand. kompaniytsiv;</li>
<li>hetman forbidden to enter into relations with other states;</li>
<li>collect taxes was only the officers;</li>
<li>complicated transition to the Cossack peasants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some concessions from Moscow were caused by its desire to prevent new demonstrations Cossack resentment.</p>
<p><b>Mnohohrishny Measures on the reorganization of public life Left Bank Hetman</b></p>
<p>Elected hetman sinful trying to protect the interests of Ukraine, sought to unite the land under one Ukrainian hetman's mace.</p>
<p>Opposing making Andrusovo agreement, he managed to get from Kyiv suburbs remained within the Left-Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>One of the activities was to strengthen Mnohohrishny Hetman's power and the gradual weakening of the role of the Cossack. To this end, and was created auxiliaries.</p>
<p>Damian sinful advocated autonomy for Ukraine, trying to overcome the pro-Moscow sentiment among the Cossack. To this end, failed to change unreliable colonels true to people.</p>
<p>This caused discontent Cossack. Resented above Hetman excessive desire for personal enrichment, and the fact that he was considered a council officer - he was negotiating with Moscow ambassadors, no military court punished even colonels handing out government positions to relatives.</p>
<p><b>DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY JOHN Samoylovych</b></p>
<p>16-17 June 1672 in Cossack Dibrova between Konotop and held Putivl General Military Council. There, with the consent of the Moscow Prince Gregory was elected hetman Romodanovskoho General Judge John Samoilovych.</p>
<p>In elections Hetman, on board the Cossack Hetman Dibrova negotiated and the Moscow government, concluding an agreement known as Konotop articles.</p>
<p>10 points of the new agreements complement Glukhivs'ka articles and compared them with the more limited the hetman.</p>
<p><b>For Konotopska sexes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>hetman prohibited without the king's decree and the officer council to send mission to other states, as well as maintain relationships with Doroshenko;</li>
<li>Hetman was not allowed to deprive officers positions, punished without the consent of the officer or board military sentence;</li>
<li>Cossack envoys were not allowed to participate in negotiations with representatives of the Polish government in Moscow for about Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Characterized 15 years of Hetman Ivan Samoilovych was his desire to create a state with strong aristocratic Hetman's power.</b></p>
<p>Way to pursue his goal he ubachav to limit the rights of the Cossack rank and file to intervene in state affairs.</p>
<p>It Samoylovych stopped convening the General Military Council and all public affairs with the council decided.</p>
<p>Aristocracy favored the formation initiated Samoylovych bunchukove Company.</p>
<p>Samoylovych defended the officers' interests, helped expand the petty landholding.</p>
<p>Despite the attempts of officers and Konotop items for maintaining order in the Hetman he kept hired (and convivial serdyutske) army, and later formed a few bands willing.</p>
<p>Like some of his predecessors, sought to secure the succession of the Hetman's power. Getman was concerned about his sons, who gave the most influential posts in the Hetman government and large estates.</p>
<p>Samoylovych strongly opposed attempts Cossacks act completely independently, trying to lure his mace Right-Bank Ukraine, is produced from the attention and Western.</p>
<p>An outstanding feature of Hetman Ivan Samoilovych, the relative stability of life in Left-Bank Ukraine was the revival of the fallen in the ruins of cultural life.</p>
<p>The biggest changes occurred in this period architecture and construction. Founders of cathedrals and churches were hetman, officers, wealthy burghers. In particular,</p>
<p>Samoylovych was the founder of Trinity Cathedral in Priluki Gustynskogo monastery, built in 1674-1676 years.</p>
<p>Places that time was the stone church of St. John the Baptist in Starodub, refectory Trinity Monastery in Chernigov (1677-1679 gg.).</p>
<p>In 1679 Trinity began building pens in Chernigov, and in 1682 - under construction by Y.Baptysta Transfiguration Cathedral Mgarsk monastery near Lubny (both cathedrals finally completed by Hetman Mazepa).</p>
<p>In foreign policy Samoylovich focusing on Moscow and hostile to Poland and Turkey was against Moscow-Polish agreement on the basis of separation of Ukraine.</p>
<p>However sought understanding of Muscovy Hetmanate and Turkey and the Crimea.</p>
<p><b>Military-political union Hetman Petro Doroshenko Turkey</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the right bank of life became more calm. Lost hetman of the Left, Doroshenko failed to act decisively.</p>
<p>To this also prompted the weakening effects on the Right Bank Ukraine and the fight for the hetman's mace to the winds.</p>
<p>Threat from Poland and the Crimea brought him into closer relations with Turkey.</p>
<p>It is through Turkey, he hoped to reject the contract and conditions Andrusovo overcome breaches of the Commonwealth, and then merge the Right Bank Left Bank one Cossack state.</p>
<p>In March 1669, Hetman called Korsun officers' council. In addition to representatives of right-bank regiments took part in it and left bank Cossacks of Zaporozhye. Council decided to take a Turkish protectorate, but refused to swear.</p>
<p>However, not all Cossacks and peasants all the Right Bank supported the agreement. Decision officers condemned and Cossacks. Opponents Doroshenko spreading rumors that he was "zaprodav Ukraine in the Turkish yoke."</p>
<p><b>Fight for hetman between Peter Doroshenko, Peter and Michael winds Khanenko</b></p>
<p>Under these conditions, the hetman Doroshenko managed to keep on the right bank.</p>
<p>Hetman's mace, he had to win, breaking the one hand, the encroachment of droughts, and the other - "the newly elected Hetman," Colonel Michael Uman Khanenko, which recognized the power of right-bank several regiments and January.</p>
<p>Khanenko election brought the situation on the Right Bank.</p>
<p>Started a bloody war between supporters Khanenko Regiment Doroshenko.</p>
<p>In early August 1671 the Polish army under the command of Crown Hetman Jan Sobieski launched military action against Ukraine.</p>
<p>In mid-October the Commonwealth has established its dominance over nearly the whole territory Bratslavshchina and late October, King Michael Vishnevetsky officially approved right-bank hetman Michael Khanenko.</p>
<p><b>Hike sultan troops to Ukraine</b></p>
<p>In late May 1672 100-120-strong army led by Sultan Mehmed IV, set off on a campaign to Bratslavshchina. So on the right bank started another war.</p>
<p>Worst thing was that the Ukrainian took it as part of both armies Doroshenko with his troops fought on the side of Turkey, Khanenko - on the side of Poland.</p>
<p>Peter Doroshenko, waiting Tatars went on the offensive and 8 July during Chetvertynivkoyu defeated Polish army units and troops Khanenko. August 18, 1672 joint Ukrainian-Turkish-Tatar forces have gained a strong Kamenetz-Podolsk fortress and moved to Galicia.</p>
<p>In early September, it was surrounded by Lions. With no means to continue the war, the Polish government October 18, 1672 signed a peace treaty in Buchach.</p>
<p><b>Under this contract,</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Turkey received from Poland Podolsk province with Kamianets;</li>
<li>Ukraine: Doroshenko under the protection of Turkey had care and Southern Bratslavshchina Kyiv region;</li>
<li>Poland left by a Galicia, Volyn and Kyiv region North.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buchatskiy agreement did not bring desired peace Right Bank, as Poland is not going to abandon the Ukrainian lands lost and looked over to restore their confidence. However Muscovy Buchatskiy perceived contract repudiation Poland Human Right Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>Doroshenko expeditions against Moscow regiments of the army and left-bank hetman</b></p>
<p>The imperial government decided to seize the opportunity, without violating truce Andrusovo, grab the Right Bank.</p>
<p>Negotiations on this issue were unsuccessful, and the king at the end of 1673 ordered Romodanovskomu Samoylovych launch a military offensive against Doroshenko.</p>
<p>By early March 1674 Moscow military magistrates and the new Left Bank Hetman captured key cities in Right Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>16-17 March Pereyaslav held a council to which the officers arrived 10 right-bank bands. At the council put Khanenko hetman's mace, Doroshenko was formally removed from power, and Hetman both sides of the Dnieper declared Samoilovych.</p>
<p>This meant the state union of both parts of Ukraine under one mace. However successful this event can not be named because it led Turkish aggression that results in the Right Bank experienced more suffering and misery.</p>
<p>Peter Doroshenko of several thousand Serdyuks Chyhyryn.</p>
<p>In July, the city surrounded Muscovite-Ukrainian troops. The siege lasted two weeks.</p>
<p>But news that the aid went Doroshenko Turkish army, which destroyed its way Ladyzhyn and Uman, forced Moscow-Ukrainian forces retreat from Chyhyryn and return to the Left Bank.</p>
<p><b>Price of extreme cruelty Right Bank was returned to power under Doroshenko.</b></p>
<p><b>Denial by Peter Doroshenko hetmanship</b></p>
<p>Such circumstances do not add popularity Doroshenko.</p>
<p>He even left Serdyuk and closest relatives.</p>
<p>To regain the confidence of Peter Doroshenko decided to abandon the Turkish protectorate. After long hesitation Hetman of all the troubles then chose Moscow.</p>
<p>October 10, 1675 at the Cossack Council Chyhyryn in the presence of Zaporozhye Ivan Sirko he promised the king. But the Moscow government did not recognize the oath.</p>
<p>In September 1676 the Moscow army and Cossacks Samoilovych besieged Chyhyryn. Doroshenko went to camp Romodanovskoho Samoilovych, September 19 passed the jewelry and swore allegiance to the king.</p>
<p><b>Chygyryns'ka hiking Turkish-Tatar army</b></p>
<p>Denial of Hetman Doroshenko Turkey perceived as an event that contradicted its political, hoped for a significant part of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Out of this unprofitable situation Sultan linked to a person Yuras Khmelnitsky.</p>
<p>In connection with the events in Ukraine Yuras was released from prison Yedykule Istanbul and declared Prince Sarmatia (Ukraine).</p>
<p>In the spring of 1677 Yuri Khmelnitsky, with detachments of Turkish troops went to the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Staying at Nemiroff, he began to send proclamations to recognize his authority. These actions impeded Hmelnychenka Samoilovych intentions to merge both banks of the Dnieper under his mace.</p>
<p><b>Center of military confrontation between the two former Hetman Hetman was the capital Chyhyryn.</b></p>
<p><b>In 1677, the First Chyhyryn march 60-90-strong Turkish-Nogai Tatar-war.</b></p>
<p>His aggressive campaign against Turkey Ukraine justify the desire to return the land and mace Yurii Khmelnytsky.</p>
<p>The Turkish government tried to use the popular name Khmelnytsky to lay on its side Ukrainian populace and neutralize the Cossacks.</p>
<p>First hit the Turks decided to inflict it Chyhyryn, because the city had a strategic importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hetman was the residence;</li>
<li>strongest fortress on the crossroads of important routes deep into the Ukraine, Poland and Muscovy;</li>
<li>Chyhyryn stood numerous Cossack-Muscovite garrison.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, she defended the castle during the siege kilkatyzhnevoyi. When the city approached the main joint Ukrainian-Muscovite forces led by Romodanovskym and Samoylovych, the Turks were forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Fails campaign in 1677 did not change the intent of the Turkish sultan master Chyhyryn entire right bank Ukraine. It is well understood Samoylovich Moscow military leaders.</p>
<p>However, if the Ukrainian defense Chyhyryn was a matter of honor in Moscow to her indifferently.</p>
<p>That is why the army chief of Moscow boyar Romodanovskyy, going to Ukraine, received secret instructions: if you can not keep Chyhyryn - destroy the fortifications and withdraw military forces from the fortress.</p>
<p><b>July 8, 1678 200,000th Turkish-Tatar army led by the Vizier Kara Mustafa surrounded Chyhyryn.</b></p>
<p>The invaders were continuous cannon fire, resorted to numerous assaults.</p>
<p>More than a month, desperately defending, Chigirinska garrison awaited the arrival of forces Romodanovskoho, however, that the Cossack capital not in a hurry.</p>
<p>In the troops approached Moscow Chyhyryn. However, never giving his defenders need help, began to prepare for the retreat.</p>
<p>CHIEF Chigirinska garrison were ordered to set fire to the powder formulations and break out of encirclement.</p>
<p><b>So when Turkish troops invaded the city, there was an explosion. Chygyryn into a ruynovysche. Reflecting the fierce onslaught of the Turks and Tatars, United Muscovite-Ukrainian troops went to the Dnieper.</b></p>
<p>Power Hmelnychenka extended only to devastated skirts. There he ruled, but failed. Turks executed him in the heater at the end of 1685</p>
<p><b>Bakhchisarai peace treaty</b></p>
<p>War of the 70's. Between Muscovy, on the one hand, and Turkey and the Crimean Khanate - the other, for the possession of land-bank Ukraine culminated in the signing Bakhchisarai 13 January 1681 peace treaty between the two countries.</p>
<p><b>Under this contract:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Turkey joins South Kyiv region, Bratslavshchina and Skirts;</li>
<li>Muscovy joins Left Bank Ukraine and Kyiv;</li>
<li>The border between Turkey and Muscovy was placed on the Dnieper;</li>
<li>For 20 years, the territory between the Bug and Dnieper was to remain uninhabited.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SIGNATURE "Eternal Peace"</b></p>
<p>Bakhchisaray Peace Treaty between Muscovy and Turkey was not lasting because they do not meet the interests of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the defeat of a massive Turkish military forces of the Holy League of Vienna in 1683, Poland regained its dominance over most of the Right-Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>May 6, 1686 in Moscow between Poland and Muscovy, signed a new contract - "eternal peace".</p>
<p>Poland recognized by Muscovy Left Bank Ukraine, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv-Siver land of Chernihiv and Starodub.</p>
<p>In addition, the Polish side abandoning claims to Kyiv, which received compensation.</p>
<p><b>Treaty of 1686 secured:</b></p>
<p>for the right to own Muscovy Hetmanate Left Bank;</p>
<p>Kyiv region North in Poland, Volhynia and Galicia;</p>
<p>Bratslavshchina and South Kyivshchyna were unoccupied neutral zone between the two countries;</p>
<p>Skirts remained under Turkish rule, though not for long, because 1699 was also incorporated into Poland.</p>
<p>"Perpetual Peace" complicated situation in Ukraine, weakening the national liberation movement, as affirmed violent division of Ukrainian lands among several states.</p>
<p><b>Crimean CAMPAIGN 1687 SOLUTION POWER OF JOHN Samoylovych</b></p>
<p>Enclosing the "eternal peace" with Poland, Muscovy joined the states that fought against Turkey and its vassal - Crimean Khanate.</p>
<p>Commitment to anti-Turkish coalition - Holy League consisting of Austria, Venice and the Commonwealth - as well as their plans, which included the elimination of the Turkish-Tatar possessions in the Black and Azov seas, and future access to the Black Sea, prompted Moscow to war.</p>
<p>In May 1687 the 100,000th Muscovite army went to the Crimea. Hike led by Queen Sofia's favorite, most influential person in Muscovy - Vasily Golitsyn.</p>
<p>On the way to Golitsyn's army joined the army of 50 thousand Ukrainian Cossacks led by Samoylovych.</p>
<p>Although great hopes pinned on this military campaign, but the combined Ukrainian-Muscovite army failed even to reach the Crimea.</p>
<ul>
<li>by the fire in the desert, burned by the Tatars;</li>
<li>lack of food, water and feed for the horses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Golitsyn ordered the army to turn back.</p>
<p>Not recognizing their own mistakes, Golitsyn was looking for the perpetrators of the failed campaign, and therefore easily transferred responsibility for Samoilovych.</p>
<p>After Hetman criticized for improper favorite queen of the campaign, and generally opposed the conclusion of the Moscow Government "perpetual peace" with Poland and the alliance with it against Turkey and the Crimea.</p>
<p>Samoilovych situation was uncertain. It complicated the position of the Cossack elite, which repelled by his arrogance Hetman, unlimited self and the desire to make the hetman's mace hereditary.</p>
<p>This is why personal interest Golitsyn and discontent led to the removal from power Samoilovych.</p>
<p>In July 1687 the camp on the river. Kolomak Samoilovych John was arrested with his family and sent to Siberia, where he died in 1690</p>
<p>Instead Cossack Council, held on 25 July 1687, elected captain general Hetman Ivan Mazepa.</p>
