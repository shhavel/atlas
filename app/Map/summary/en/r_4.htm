<p>Earth - the only known planet so far, which thanks to the optimum amount of light and heat, there is life. Our planet immediately after the formation was the same as now. Over the years (more than 4.5 billion years old), she has come a long way. From shapeless clot of gas and dust was formed the vast cosmic body mass.</p>
<p>Intense internal processes of the Earth led to the formation of basal layer of the Earth's crust, atmosphere and hydrosphere (doheolohichnyy stage).</p>
<p>The next stage of the Earth - Geology. It is marked by the formation of granite and osadovohosharivzemnoyi cortex and the advent of the atmospheric composition of living organisms necessary for nitrogen and oxygen. Geological time is divided into five eras, each of which accounts for a certain stage of relief formation and development of life on the planet.</p>
<p>The earth consists of several layers: core, mantle, crust. The crust of the planet is not uniform: its form sedimentary, granite, basalt rocks. The earth's crust ranges from 7-10 km - under the oceans and 30-40 km - in the plains, 80 km - in the mountains. In addition, the oceanic layer of the earth's crust is missing granite.</p>
<p>Throughout geological history of the earth's surface is in constant motion. Crust formation continues today. Divided faults huge blocks of the earth's crust - the lithosphere plates move at speeds up to 10 cm per year. It is due to the horizontal movement of lithospheric plates formed the highest mountain ranges Himilayi, Andes, Cordillera and Carpathians and the Crimean Mountains. There are seven basic (African, Eurasian, Pacific, North American, South American, Indo-Australian, Nazca) and a few small plates. There are places on the planet where crustal movements especially noticeable. In seismic zones is intense differences or collision of lithospheric plates, accompanied by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>
