<p><b>Structure of the Earth</b></p>
<p>It should be noted that the person is still able to penetrate into the depths of our planet, only modest depth - the most well reached a total of 12 km. Therefore, scientists must study the internal structure of our planet, fixing by means of special devices fluctuations in the earth's crust during earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and man-made explosions.</p>
<p>Caused by these vibrations are called seismic waves. They are distributed in the "body" of the planet at different speeds. With this in mind, the researchers concluded that the Earth is heterogeneous and consists of separate layers: core, mantle and crust. The core is a massive ball in the center of the Earth, at a depth of 2900 km of the surface, a diameter of almost 7000 km. Substances in the nucleus in properties resemble metals, but behave like liquid or gaseous substance. Therefore, the researchers concluded that the hot core to a temperature of 4000 째 C, and the temperature of the central part reaches 5000 째 C. Therefore, at a depth of 5100 km distinguish so-called "inner core", which is harder than the outer part of the kernel and its properties slightly different from it.</p>
<p>One-third of the entire volume of the Earth, and 67% of the weight falls on the mantle (from the Greek "mantion" - blanket), which contains over core and comes close to the surface. It is obviously made up of mostly solid whose temperature ranges from 4000 째 C at a depth near the core, up to 1000 째 C at the top. At a depth of 150 - 200 km from the surface in the upper mantle revealed a special layer - the asthenosphere (from Gr. "Astenos" - weak and "sphere" - the ball) that is in a viscous state.</p>
<p>Above from the mantle is the crust - upper rigid shell of the Earth, consisting of rocks and minerals. In comparison with the thickness of core and mantle, it looks like a thin film that covers hot, glowing mass of mineral resources.</p>
