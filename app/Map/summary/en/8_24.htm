<p><b>PERSONALITY</b></p>
<p>John Skoropadskyi was born in 1646 in the city. Uman in petty Cossack family. Sources preserved testimony of the grandfather of the future hetman - Fedor. He participated in the National War, and family legend, was killed in the battle Zhovtovods'ka. About Hetman father - Elijah also left little evidence. From sources we learn that in the middle of the XVII century. He lived in Uman with three sons: John, Basil and Paul. After the death of his father John and Basil (Jr., Paul, was in the Tatar captivity) had suffered many disasters, were forced to move to the Left Bank. Work at the new place, John was appointed hetman office. Since starting his long climb official positions. It is known that the sympathetic Skoropadsky Hetman Ivan Mazepa. After the rebellion antymoskovskoho Mazepa Starodubsky Colonel, as mentioned above, could not support the hetman, since Moscow's troops entered Starodub. Becoming a hetman, he never denounced Mazepa "traitor" as required formal communication, revealing in a way favorable to its former hetman. He died at the Deaf in 1722</p>
<p>The life of Paul Polubotko is not much different from the fate of many other members of the Cossack elite. The exact date of birth unknown acting hetman. Researchers believe that he was born about 1660 came from the old Cossack Hetman kind. He graduated from the Kyiv Mohyla Academy, knew foreign languages, he made love in poetry. From 1706 - Chernihiv colonel. He has held senior positions Cossack. In 1708 was one of the contenders for the hetman and probably would have mace, if elections were held in an old Cossack tradition. During the rebellion against Muscovy Mazepa Polubotok not support it. With Hetman Skoropadskim lived in harmony. Evidence of good relations between them is the fact that Polubotok Hetman Skoropadskiy became the second man in the Ukrainian state. After the death Skoropadskiy Polubotok Paul - the only candidate for the hetman. In October 1723 acting hetman Polubotok as the king was imprisoned in the fortress, which sat before his death, December 18, 1724</p>
<p>Apostle Daniel was born in 1654 in petty Cossack family. His youth had not survived. Unknown place and also training future hetman. Because Daniel was a man of literate Apostle, suggest that he, like many other children Cossack, he studied at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. It is not known under what circumstances and when the Apostle Daniel began his military service. But in 1682 his 28-year-old Cossack, was elected Colonel Mirgorodsky. He kept this government, under some assumptions, intermittently, for 45 years. The age at which the Apostle was elected colonel, and his stay in this government - a record in the history of the Hetmanate. He participated in campaigns against the Turks and Tatars, and took the fortress Hazikermen Ochakov. In October 1708, along with Mazepa went to a meeting with the Swedish king. But less than a month was unexpected: an ardent secessionist policy Mazepa brought the king Danylo Apostol remorse. In 1723 Danylo Apostol took part in writing Kolomaksky petitions. Before putting his signature, made significant changes. He was one of the richest rulers Hetman, earned fame and merit careful owner. Hetman was elected in 1727 Given the intensification of the colonial policy of the Russian Empire on Ukraine's sovereignty remains advocated Hetman. He died in 1734, buried in built his expense in Mhar in Poltava.</p>
<p>Fate Kirill Razumovsky (1728-1803) - the last Ukrainian hetman was happy. Born March 18, 1728 in the village. Chernihiv plowshares into a family of Cossack Grigory Razumovsky. At age of 14 he was in the king's palace. Alexey Razumovsky taken care of well educated younger brother: he seized bookish wisdom in the care of the best contemporary teachers and educators, and in 1743 went to study abroad. Visiting Germany, France, Italy, Cyril spring 1745 returned to St. Petersburg, where he was waiting for the title of count. In 1746, 18-year old boy, Kirill Razumovsky became president of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the hetman's mace was 22 years of age. During Hetman Razumovsky longer lived in St. Petersburg than in Ukraine, which managed the affairs of the hetman's office, headed by H. thermal. In 1762 Ukrainian hetman was active in Domestic coup Catherine II. After the elimination of Hetman Razumovsky while he was a member of the State Council (1768-1771). Subsequently withdrew from public affairs, lived in St. Petersburg and abroad, in the suburban estate, Peter Rozumovsky. The last 9 years of his life in Baturin, where he died in January 1803</p>
<p><b>TERROR IN UKRAINE AFTER Battle of Poltava</b></p>
<p>After the Battle of Poltava Ukraine wave king of terror.</p>
<p>Punitive measures related to all aspects of life and have diverse expression - from the death penalty ban Mazepas to print books in Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Many in the administration were deprived estates and government posts.</p>
<p>Instead, the important positions were given to officials not to Ukrainian patriots, and with Russians, Germans, etc., and one Ukrainian officers who maintained loyalty to the king.</p>
<p>Many officers were arrested and exiled to Siberia. Russia and sent to family Mazepas, and arranged themselves to hunt all over Europe.</p>
<p>For example, a nephew of Andrew Mazepa Voinarovsky was arrested in Hamburg in October 1716</p>
<p>The same fate befell Mazepa General Hertsyka captain Gregory, who was arrested in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Countries of Europe Moscow agents scoured in search of Philip Orlik and his family.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Poltava Moscow troops behaved in the Ukrainian lands as conquered country. From their tyranny suffered not only supporters of the Hetman, but also civilians.</p>
<p>Extremely difficult test for Ukrainian steel forced channel, the construction of fortifications, military "grassroots" campaigns and more. Duzhyh and rich peasants often sent to St. Petersburg, Astrakhan, the Caucasus, using cheap labor.</p>
<p>Thus, in 1716 the construction of the Volga-Don canal near Tsaritsyn sent 10 thousand. Cossacks.</p>
<p>In 1718 a new department here sent Ukrainian troops. Another division that year built a fortified line above,. Terek in the Caucasus.</p>
<p>In 1721 10 thousand. Cossacks were sent to construction of the Ladoga Canal, and in 1722 they took the new 10 thousand. Cossacks.</p>
<p>The number of those who come from such campaigns, ranged from 30 to 60%, the rest of the Cossacks and peasants died of unbearable living conditions, epidemics, injury, etc.</p>
<p>Thus, the tsarist government led to the extinction of tens of thousands of Ukrainian.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Poltava significantly increased attack and Ukrainian statehood. In addition to direct pressure, the Russian administration to have a pretext for interference in Ukrainian affairs, provoked hostility among officers and Hetman, between officers and farmers, etc., sought to create the impression that all evil comes from the Hetman and officers, and all is well - from Moscow.</p>
<p><b>Hetman Ivan Skoropadskiy. RESHETYLIVSKI ARTICLES</b></p>
<p>Hetman Ivan Skoropadskiy (1708-1722 gg.), According to tradition, was launched with the signing of papers.</p>
<p>But Peter refused to do so, explaining his decision to war circumstances.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Poltava, July 17, Skoropadskiy while the Cossack army in camp under Reshetilovka, appealed to the king of the 14 paragraphs of articles.</p>
<p>In them, he requested to confirm the rights and liberties Hetman and solve many important matters of everyday life.</p>
<p>In response, Peter sent a nominal decree, which does not like the interstate treaty article.</p>
<p>In the royal decree rights and liberties confirmed in such a way that meet the interests of Muscovy. Subsequently promised dates and articles.</p>
<p>As to other matters, the king said that during a campaign under the command of Russian generals have to pass not only simple Cossacks, and even the hetman.</p>
<p>Governor inhabit Peter testified in Ukrainian cities, as before; in the Ukrainian case they do not interfere, except for the "state" as "treason" (for "treason" were understood any action going against the wishes of the king).</p>
<p>An important innovation was the appointment of a resident Izmailov royal hetman. He was given the right to exercise control over the Hetman and the Government of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Peculiar attachment to the decree were overt and covert article Hour.</p>
<p>These items are called ground troops Zaporizhzhya "Little Russian land", which together with the resident royal hetman had to hold the entire population, including rebels, Cossacks, "in silence and obedience to the Great State"</p>
<p>Nakazuvalosya also "svoyevoltsiv eliminate" do not allow them to settle in one place, especially on the Host. Foreign envoys Hetman had to make only with Being. Last obliged immediately to inform the king about the visits and calls and send letters brought by ambassadors.</p>
<p>In addition, residents had to watch to the Hetman without permission of the king did not alter the structure of the military posts in the General Office and not appointed new colonels took away and do not give anyone the estates.</p>
<p>Resident duty was to Hetman government informed the king of all their income.</p>
<p>Residence was appointed Hetman deaf, which was located almost on the border of Moscow.</p>
<p>Reported that when the hetman maintained two Russian regiments, however, will be a royal resident.</p>
<p>So no confirmation on which ancient rights and liberties in the decree of Peter I was. On the contrary, the measures introduced, turned the once autonomous Ukrainian state on the typical "suburb of Muscovy."</p>
<p><b>Measures aimed at undermining ECONOMY Hetmanate</b></p>
<p>The imperial government has set for itself the main goal: to save the Hetmanate economic independence, to subordinate its economic life of Russia's economy and turn to a reliable source of income. King's activities primarily related to trade.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the XVIII century. Ukraine has traditionally maintained close trade ties with Central and Western Europe. Peter King sought to block his decrees significant trade routes, forcing the Ukrainian merchant rolls back in.</p>
<p>Such prohibitions and restrictions used the Russian government and the importation of foreign goods into Ukraine. These measures have had to make Ukrainian instead of buying foreign products manufactory young Muscovite.</p>
<p>Inhibited the development of Russian trade and customs policy, set of Russian-Ukrainian border duty not used for the enrichment of Ukrainian state treasury, and to Moscow.</p>
<p>One of the measures that hindered the development of the Ukrainian economy, the Russian government was to sell the Ukrainian territory copper money to gold and silver in circulation remained mostly population, enriched by the Russian treasury.</p>
<p>Ruining the economy of Ukraine permanent residence in its territory a great Russian army (10 thousand.) That was maintained at the expense of the Ukrainian population.</p>
<p><b>Attack of tsarism ON UKRAINIAN CULTURE</b></p>
<p>To finally conquer Ukrainian, Peter struck education and typography, trying to keep the activity of such powerful cultural centers like Kiev-Mohyla Academy, Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra.</p>
<p>In 1709, Peter I ordered the Kiev governor send abroad all "Polish" (ie right-origin) students and report how many students will remain "Little Russian" - natives of Hetman, as well as monks are teachers from the right bank.</p>
<p>Dramatically worsened the situation of the Church of the Kyiv Metropolis. When in 1718 he died Kyiv Metropolitan, the Russian government banned new vote. In 1722 the first hierarchs of the Kyiv Metropolis was given the title of Archbishop of Kiev and Little Russia. Assign it had a church synod led by the king in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>So, Kiev Metropolis into a regular diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>Destruction of Ukrainian culture performed by such devious actions as poaching Ukrainian scientists, theologians, writers and teachers from Kyiv to St. Petersburg and Moscow.</p>
<p>Received high ecclesiastical office, they had spoken and written word to glorify the king and his policies, and Mazepa, and all those like him, dared to speak out against the kings, fully tackled.</p>
<p>This went way Theophanes Prokopovych Stefan Jaworski, Gabriel Buginsky and many other talented members of the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>From the time of Peter and Ukraine began to export historical monuments, rare books and more. In 1720 the king ordered the governor of Kyiv "in all the monasteries ... inspect and take long charters and other original letters, and historical books, manuscripts and printed."</p>
<p><b>FORMATION Little Russian College</b></p>
<p>Evidence of complete destruction of the state of the autonomy of Ukraine was the creation in April 1722 of the Little Russian Collegium.</p>
<p>The decree was announced April 29, 1722</p>
<p>It reported on a Little Russian Collegium of six officers of the Russian regiments stationed in Ukraine, led by foreman Velyaminovym.</p>
<p>Hetman show of obedience Ministry of Foreign Affairs and subordinate to the Senate as an ordinary province of the empire.</p>
<p>Brigadier Velyaminov arrived Glukhova July 21, 1722 at led by the Little Russian Collegium relied very wide powers.</p>
<p>Board took over all administrative leadership of the Left-Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>Members of the Little Russian Collegium had to supervise the activities of the Hetman, general and regimental officers.</p>
<p>They controlled the establishment and collection of taxes to the royal treasury, quartering of Russian soldiers and officers in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Little Russian College oversaw the activities of the General Military Chancellery.</p>
<p>Russian officials followed the distribution of landholdings among officers.</p>
<p>However, the Little Russian Collegium was higher appellate authority.</p>
<p>Also Velyaminov had discretion to intervene in any sphere of Ukrainian lives as full owner of the land.</p>
<p><b>Fighting Cossack sergeant FOR RESTORATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS OF UKRAINE</b></p>
<p>Royal Decree on the formation of the Little Russian Collegium heavily struck John Skoropadskiy. In Ukraine, Hetman returned from Moscow, where he attended the celebrations on winning the Great Northern War, very sick.</p>
<p>Facing imminent death, he instructed the hetman duties Chernihiv colonel Paul Polubotko that zastupav, and on a trip to Moscow.</p>
<p>Paul Polubotok launched activities aimed at restoring the Cossack order.</p>
<p>Acting hetman made reform of the court to limit the power of the Little Russian Collegium.</p>
<p>He made the General Court collectively, resolutely fight against bribery and delays in provincial courts, established the procedure for filing and appeals.</p>
<p>In December 1722 Polubotok ordered, the complaints of people considered inferior to the higher authority of the Ukrainian people, and not submitted directly to the Little Russian Collegium.</p>
<p>However, despite vigorous measures Polubotko and officers, Peter in April 1723 gave the Little Russian Collegium such authority that made it to the sovereign Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukrainian government with its military General's office was subject Little Russian Collegium.</p>
<p>Numerous petitions (petition), containing the main Ukrainian demand - to elect a new Hetman, the king dismissed.</p>
<p>In addition, the new decree in April 1723 he removed power commander Hetman of the Cossack army, passing her General Golitsyn, who led the Russian army in Ukraine.</p>
<p>May 22, 1723 Polubotko the general secretary and the judge was summoned to St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>However, acting hetman delayed departure, preparing new documents requesting the restoration of civil rights in Ukraine. Were two petitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>one had to sign general officers and colonels</li>
<li>second - Regimental officers and captains.</li>
</ul>
<p>In June Polubotok Paul went north and 3 August reached Petersburg.</p>
<p>After leaving acting hetman movement for expanding the autonomy of the Cossack state led by Colonel Mirgorodsky Danylo Apostol.</p>
<p>In particular, he has made the conclusion Kolomaksky petitions - articles signed in mid-August - early September 1723 in the district. Kolomak that in Poltava, representatives of the Cossack.</p>
<p>In them, as in previous articles, the officers complained of poverty Cossacks and peasants through military service, poor harvests and burdensome fees Malorussian board.</p>
<p>Articles again raised the question of exemption from taxation of estates officers.</p>
<p>Was also about shortcomings in the legal proceedings that their Cossack government to fix without outside interference.</p>
<p>Finally, the officers requested permission to choose Hetman.</p>
<p>Signed petitions Kolomaksky Danylo Apostol submitted to the General Military Chancellery.</p>
<p>Officials learned of plans Polubotko Paul decided to immediately send to the Embassy of the Russian capital with which to convey the article.</p>
<p>However Cossack envoys detained Little Russian College. Then to St. Petersburg was secretly sent military clerk John Romanovich.</p>
<p>Sunday morning November 10, 1723 Envoy General Military Chancellery Kolomaksky petitions personally emperor Peter II</p>
<p>After presenting "petitions" on the orders of Peter was arrested most active authors.</p>
<p>More than a year prolonged interrogation Ukrainian officers in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Against acting hetman was initiated legal proceedings on charges of treason - of secret communication with Hetman in exile Philip Orlik.</p>
<p>But the trial never took place because 18 December 1724 in Petropavlovsk casemate Polubotok Paul died.</p>
<p><b>RESTORATION Hetman. Danylo Apostol</b></p>
<p>Fighting Cossack hetman vote for the resolution was ineffective: the death of John Skoropadskiy and hetman Pavlo Polubotko elections occur.</p>
<p>Ukraine rules of Little Russian College. However, there was some easing of tsarist policy of Ukraine. It was coupled with the death of Peter in January 1725</p>
<p>February 8, 1725 Catherine and was released from custody of the Ukrainian officers who were imprisoned along with Polubotko.</p>
<p><b>Causes Recovery Hetman</b></p>
<p>In the summer of 1727 increased tension in Russian-Turkish relations. Russia started preparations for a new war. The government of Peter II, relying on military power Cossacks sought to win over Cossack officers.</p>
<p>It eliminated the Little Russian Collegium and allowed elections hetman.</p>
<p>Not least in making that decision played a personal interest Menshikov - the person leading the court for a minor Peter II.</p>
<p>Menshikov hoped in this way to expand the already vast estates in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In this situation, the sole and undisputed candidate to the hetman was Danylo Apostol.</p>
<p>In the elections, held on October 1 in Deaf and thrown off the ceremony rather oath in 73-year-old Apostle voted unanimously. Contracting articles, as well as from Skoropadskim, was signed.</p>
<p>Thus, its main business Apostle saw the signing of a traditional Russian-Ukrainian agreement.</p>
<p>To this end, the newly elected Hetman decided to take a trip to St. Petersburg for the coronation of Peter II.</p>
<p>In the Russian capital Ukrainian hetman put great efforts to rectify the matter, submitted written petitions, met with influential dignitaries.</p>
<p>In early March, the Apostle Daniel began talks with the president of the Foreign Board of Count Golovkin, gave him a prepared paper. Only in August Hetman received in response to their proposals "Rishytelni points." They had a form of imperial government decree hetman.</p>
<p><b>"Rishytelni points" in 1728</b></p>
<p>According to the "new contract" Hetman deprived of the right to negotiate with other countries.</p>
<p>Only allowed to solve border problems with Poland and the Crimea, but under the supervision of the Russian resident.</p>
<p>The military governments were elected by the people of the house, however they are approved by the emperor.</p>
<p>Lower officers claimed hetman. The highest judicial body became General Court.</p>
<p>It consisted of three Russians and three Ukrainian and led by Hetman, but "chief judge" was considered the king.</p>
<p>Lifted ban Russians to buy land in Ukraine, although it noted that the new landowners obey the Ukrainian administration.</p>
<p>New Articles considerably restrict the already curtailed the rights and liberties of Ukraine.</p>
<p>As for Hetman Apostol, the rights granted to him even less than Skoropadsky.</p>
<p>Thus, "Rishytelni items" were not bilateral agreement. They had the appearance of order, regulation supreme power of the Russian Empire. The document was intended to regulate the internal life Hetmanate as part of a single state.</p>
<p><b>Reform Danylo Apostol</b></p>
<p>Given the realities of Apostle Daniel started to implement reforms aimed at streamlining the internal life of Hetman.</p>
<p>Reforms conducted in the areas of justice, finance, land affairs, trade and so on.</p>
<p>With a view to resolving the land of the Apostle during 1729-1731 years. Held a general investigation of the estates. As a result of this event in the state was facing a lot of land, arbitrarily seized from private ownership.</p>
<p>Many efforts have been made to revitalize the Apostle Ukrainian trade. Getman was able to reverse many restrictions and harassment, introduced by Peter I. For example, with the assistance of Daniel Apostle Ukrainian merchants back right to export goods to Western markets; was again established trade relations with the Crimea and more.</p>
<p>Pursuing reform of Finance, the Apostle first installed the exact budget of public expenditure; while among the expenditures singled out the section that was used for the maintenance of Cossack administration hired troops, artillery and more. Getman also identified ways of filling the state treasury Hetman.</p>
<p>Changes in legal proceedings related to reforming the courts, the introduction of mandatory documents, reduce to a collection of laws that were used in the Ukrainian judiciary. Regimental courts were divided into two types: for business critical and criminal (ie for crimes) and for small cases. Centesimal and rural courts turned to peer (shared, common).</p>
<p>In addition, overcoming the resistance of the Moscow government, the Apostle restored Hetman right to appoint general officers and colonels.</p>
<p>By Hetman Apostol could significantly reduce the number of Russians in the Ukrainian administration. Was limited to six regiments of Russian in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Thus, the Apostle Daniel managed to temporarily slow down the process of converting Hetmanate administrative unit of the Russian Empire, at least for a while, the rights and freedoms that have remained in Ukrainian.</p>
<p><b>Establishment of a new Host</b></p>
<p>1734 more than 30 thousand. Cossacks of the territories belonged to the Crimean Khan and Kamyansko Oleshkovskaya Zaporizhzhya Sich returned and 7 km from the former Chortomlyk (old) New Host laid in January.</p>
<p>New January stood on the banks. Underground, which flows into the Dnieper next Chortomlyk. That is why this January called Pidpilnenskoyu.</p>
<p>Zaporozhian formed the original administrative-territorial system. Land was divided into eight palankas - districts.</p>
<p>Total land Zaporozhian Host covering a huge area of ​​steppe Ukraine.</p>
<p>During the New Host extremely quicken economic activity Cossacks. As in ancient times, the Cossacks showed their individuality soldiers farmers.</p>
<p>Economic climate in Zaporozhye were then defend or not. But there was no forced labor, serfdom. This fact attracted as ever, numerous fugitives from all over Ukraine, even because of its limits.</p>
<p>The farm occupied a significant place winterers officers and wealthy Cossacks. Most of the products went to market.</p>
<p><b>ACTIVITIES "BOARD Hetman's government"</b></p>
<p>After the death of Daniel Apostol 1734 election of a new hetman frustrated. The Russian government, limiting state of Ukraine, ordered the government to implement the Left Bank Hetmanate Board's government.</p>
<p>This institution consisted of six people - three Russians and three Ukrainian, but all power belonged to the Russian Prince Alexei Shahovskomu.</p>
<p>In its activities, the Board's government had "items Rishytelnymy" Hetman Danylo Apostol.</p>
<p>Under the royal charter, the Board's government had to act to elect a new Hetman.</p>
<p>However, when it is intended elections Hetman, the document is not specified.</p>
<p>Instead, Prince Shakhovskoi traditionally received secret instructions which he nakazuvalos in any way to convince Ukrainian that all their woes - by Hetman negligent, so do not rush to elections.</p>
<p>To pacify the Ukrainian officers in the manual advised strongly encourage the Russian-Ukrainian marriages.</p>
<p>Board Hetman government acted in 1750</p>
<p>There was this activity willful disregard of the rights of all segments of the Ukrainian people, the deteriorating economic situation worsening domestic situation.</p>
<p>Particularly difficult period came in years when the Empress of Russia was Anna Ioannivna. Suspicious and cruel, she introduced the Secret Chancellery - "Word and Deed sovereign."</p>
<p>Nyshporky secret office under pain of death obliged to inform the population "word and deed", ostensibly against the Empress. Libel became time only basis for political accusations that entailed the death, torture, exile.</p>
<p>In 1735 the Russian government has significantly reduced the registry Cossack troops. According to the order, left bank Cossacks were divided by the wealthy - Cossacks elected and impoverished - helpers. Impoverished Cossacks, who could not support themselves during the campaign, removed from the register.</p>
<p>But the heaviest burden for Ukraine was started by Russia's war against Turkey 1735-1739 gg., Since the Ukrainian population maintained the Russian army and Cossack regiments were directly involved in campaigns.</p>
<p>Russian military leaders, including Munnich, neglect of material resources of Ukraine did not cared and the fate of the Cossacks, who killed thousands.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, the Board officials Hetman government does not care about the advancement of Ukrainian speaking obedient tool of the Russian government.</p>
<p>The situation has improved a little Left Bank Ukraine, where Russia went down to the throne of Elizabeth. Peter's daughter Elizabeth took the imperial throne in November 1741 as a result of a palace coup.</p>
<p>It was not peculiar to a specific charity, and some changes in the position of Ukraine conditioned by a number of internal and external political circumstances.</p>
<p>Played a role, of course, Ukrainian environment Empress: her husband was Ukrainian Alexei Razumovsky. Therefore, the court of Elizabeth was the fashion for all things Ukrainian: there was a lot of Ukrainian singers and Bandura, the Domestic banquets served Ukrainian dishes and more.</p>
<p>While the empress in Kiev in 1744 Cossackofficers requested to allow elections hetman. Elizabeth did not mind, but gave no specific commitments.</p>
<p>Therefore, the case dragged on election Hetman another six years.</p>
<p><b>RESTORATION Hetman 1750 Hetman Kirill Razumovsky ITS ACTIVITIES</b></p>
<p><b>Recovery Hetman in 1750 was caused by:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The position of the elders who persistently sought Recovery Hetman of the imperial court.</li>
<li>Increase Ukrainian dissatisfaction with their economic situation and the escalation in connection with the domestic situation in Hetman.</li>
<li>Threat of war against Prussia and the likely need to use in the event of such a war capabilities Hetman.</li>
<li>Need to restore the economic and strategic potential of Ukraine for use in future wars against Turkey.</li>
<li>Candidate for Empress Elizabeth hetmancy nominated the younger brother of her husband Alexei Razumovsky - Cyril. Elections Hetman of Left-bank Ukraine was scheduled for February 22, 1750</li>
<li>Royal Decree of June 5, 1750, Elizabeth approved Kirill Razumovsky Hetman government.</li>
<li>March 13, 1751, while in St. Petersburg, Kirill Razumovsky in court church swore allegiance to the empress, received from the hands of Elizabeth hetman's mace and other jewelry.</li>
<li>Only in mid-July 1751 the newly elected Hetman arrived Glukhova.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Kirill Razumovsky measures to restore the independent actions of state administrative bodies Hetmanate</b></p>
<p>In October 1751 the power of hetman was given the Sich. Back Hetmanate and Kyiv.</p>
<p>Relations with the Left-Bank Ukraine again pinned to the College of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Kirill Razumovsky started without approval from Russian officials to appoint colonels and distribute land.</p>
<p>Increased positions Cossack, who was granted the right in the absence of Hetman Hetmanate. Regular was convening in Deaf officer council.</p>
<p>However pozhvavlyuvalosya economic life. Restoration began Baturin, which was returned to the status of capital of the Cossack, and Glukhova, which contained the residence of the Hetman.</p>
<p>Getman seek to measures that restrict the arbitrariness of the Russian officials who were in Ukraine. In particular, without the permission of arrest Ukrainian Hetman prohibited, except criminals.</p>
<p>Individual action plans Hetman contradicted the imperial government that did not wanted to strengthen Ukrainian autonomy. Therefore, despite the great influence at court Cyril Razumovsky Empress, in 1754 there was a set of regulations that restrict the hetman's power.</p>
<p>Razumovsky was forbidden to appoint colonels, and only allowed to propose candidates.</p>
<p>In response to a request to restore the independent foreign relations Left Bank Hetman Razumovsky received categorical refusal.</p>
<p>Subject to special control financial affairs Hetman.</p>
<p>Kirill Razumovsky firmest measures aimed at the renewal of life Hetman, fell to 60-s. XVIII century. Back to Glukhova after another long trip to St. Petersburg and Moscow in early 1760, Hetman visited all the shelves Hetman. The trip convinced him of the need for significant changes in the administration.</p>
<p>The first face justice reform. Back to Coll Hetmanate for revision. However, the complete systematization of Ukrainian legislation failed last hetman.</p>
<p>Kirill Razumovsky judicial reform also included changes in the activities of the military court.</p>
<p>Universals in 1763 Hetman allowed regiment offices and asylum-memorialist apply directly to the General Court. Thus a system of justice was brought General office and significantly reduce the number of courts.</p>
<p>Also envisages the creation of new judicial institutions. In each regiment establishing the two county and two chamberlain courts. Also created hrodski courts. Following universal Razumovsky in cities with a circle znachkovyh or centesimal officers began to choose romp.</p>
<p>Ukraine proposed to be divided into 20 judicial districts.</p>
<p>Hetman Attempts to revive the old system of justice of the Commonwealth proved its commitment Hetmanate convert from military to civilian gentry state.</p>
