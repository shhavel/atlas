Hetman received a good education at home, was well acquainted with the Scriptures, knew several languages ​​- Greek, Latin, Polish. He studied Yuri Khmelnitsky in Kiev-Mohyla Academy, but not for long, because due to worsening health Hetman son returned to Chygyryn, where he continued his studies at home.</p>
<p>Name hetmanycha the sources mentioned more often after 1653, when the death of his elder brother Timosha he became sole heir Bogdan. Old Hetman preparing the ground for transfer of Yuri clubs, including appointed 16-year-old son acting hetman in a responsible campaigns. But as they say in the proverb, it is necessary to mace head. Yuri Khmelnitsky could become a good scientist, a writer, but he was quite incapable as hetman and military leader.</p>
<p>Paul Teterya came from the Kiev Ukrainian gentry. He was born in the 20's. XVII. Trained became subscription (clerk) in Lutsk grodskij court. In 1648 joined Bogdan Khmelnitsky. From 1649 - Pereyaslav regimental clerk, from 1653 - Pereyaslav colonel. Paul had a remarkable ability Teterya diplomat, for which he especially appreciated Bogdan Khmelnitsky. While in Chyhyryn hetman, he participated in almost all diplomatic negotiations. Yes, 1649 was led by the embassy to Transylvanian Prince George (Dyerdya) II Rakoczy; 1652 accompanied Timosha Khmelnytsky trip to Iasi, where he had married the daughter of Moldavian master. In 1654, along with Bogdanovich, Zarudny led an embassy to Moscow, where he discussed and approved by Ukrainian-Moscow Treaty. Teterya was one of the authors Hadiach contract in 1658 and Slobodyshche Treaty in 1660 after the death of Daniel Vyhovsky (brother of John Vyhovsky) married his widow - daughter of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Catherine.</p>
<p><b>Hetman Yurii Khmelnitsky.</b></p>
<p><b>Pereyaslav treaty of 1659</b></p>
<p>Hetman Yuri Khmelnytsky was elected September 28, 1659</p>
<p>His Hetman Yurii Khmelnytsky decided to start a new treaty with Moscow.</p>
<p>He sought equal and mutually beneficial conditions that would allow to preserve the independence of the Ukrainian state in confederation with Moscow.</p>
<p>However, negotiations were held October 17, 1659 in Pereyaslav, Ukraine had to undesirable results. Pressure Moscow governor and 40,000th Moscow's troops led by Yuri Khmelnitsky and officers to sign an option agreement proposed by the tsarist diplomats commanders.</p>
<p>At the same time representatives of the Moscow tsar resorted to brutal lie, giving their gender as having concluded their Bogdan Khmelnitsky.</p>
<p><b>Pereyaslav treaty of 1659</b></p>
<p>The agreement, signed by Yuri Khmelnytsky, unlike the agreement in 1654, was unequal.</p>
<p>Moscow governor received the right to come to the garrison not only in Kyiv, but also to Pereyaslav, Nizhyn, Chernihiv Bratslav and Uman.</p>
<p>Hetman government was forbidden to pursue an independent foreign policy, namely to conclude international agreements, to accept foreign ambassadors and others.</p>
<p>Kyiv Metropolitan had to acknowledge the supremacy of the Patriarch of Moscow (Ukrainian Orthodox Church rejected this article as illegal).</p>
<p>Forbidden without the king's permission to re-elect the hetman, and declare war or sending armies to help neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Hetman lost the right to appoint and dismiss the general officers and colonels.</p>
<p>So Pereyaslav treaty in 1659 secured a change in Ukrainian-Muscovite political relations. Ukrainian state was losing independence, becoming an autonomous part of Muscovy. Although autonomy was then still quite broad, action tsarist clearly showed that the attack on the independence of Ukraine will continue.</p>
<p><b>Chudnovsky CAMPAIGN 1660 and making Slobodyshche treatise</b></p>
<p>Another foreign policy measures Yuri Khmelnitsky was hiking Ukrainian-Muscovite troops in Western Ukraine. The aim of the campaign was to liberate western lands from the government of Poland.</p>
<p>Obviously, however, was the fact that two other party transactions - Poland and Muscovy, which broke the truce and resumed military operations to achieve complete dominance over Ukraine, will make efforts to prevent the unification and strengthening of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Major developments have taken place in the area of ​​campaign Chudnov in Volyn. They ended the defeat of Russian troops surrender and the signing of Hetman Yu.Hmelnytskoho October 7 Slobodyshche treatise.</p>
<p><b>Slobodyshche treatise in 1660</b></p>
<p>The treatise was developed based Hadiach contract, but its text has undergone significant changes.</p>
<p>It was resolved article about Grand Duchy of Rus. It was supposed to return the Polish nobility and magnates of all estates in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Hetman denied foreign relations; He was obliged to provide military assistance to Poland in its wars with other countries.</p>
<p>Ukrainian state under the Treaty became autonomous only part of the Commonwealth. Could Slobodyshche treatise Ukraine did not bring peace. The internal situation of the Cossack state even more complicated, because there was a threat of transformation Ukrainian territory on the scene of fierce fighting between Muscovy and the Commonwealth.</p>
<p><b>Implications Chudniv campaign and signing the Treaty Slobodyshche</b></p>
<p>The new agreement with Poland was not accepted by much of the left-bank Cossacks.</p>
<p>Ordinary Cossacks and the officers refused to recognize the authority of Yuri Khmelnitsky.</p>
<p>Livoberezhniy shelves oath to the king. Movement against Hmelnychenka led by his uncle How Somko who wanted to take hetman.</p>
<p>However Somko was not the only contender for the hetman's mace. Hetman sought and Colonel Vasily Nijinsky Zolotarenko.</p>
<p>In Moscow, successfully took advantage of the infighting in Ukraine. Supporting one or the other candidate, the Moscow government exacerbated the situation and at the same time strengthened its power in the Left. And most of all liked the Moscow Tsar Ivan zealous Bryukhovetsky - then ataman Zaporizhzhya Sich.</p>
<p>Did not want to abandon the Ukrainian lands and Poland.</p>
<p>Intervention of other states in opposition to various Cossack groups in the struggle for the hetman's mace led to the division of Ukraine on the Left Bank and Right Bank, who fought each other, one on the side of Moscow, the other - on the side of Poland. Thus, in Ukraine began a new civil war.</p>
<p><b>Hetman Pavlo Grouse ITS ACTIVITIES (1663-1665 gg.)</b></p>
<p>Yuri Khmelnitsky desire to suppress speech antyhetmanski 1661-1662 biennium. Failed.</p>
<p>Young, Hetman finally decided to renounce clubs.</p>
<p>Convened in early January 1663 Council Chyhyryn elected Hetman Pavlo Teterya and Yuri Khmelnitsky soon became a monk under the name of Gideon and became abbot of the monastery of Korsun.</p>
<p>After the refusal of Yuri Khmelnitsky hetmanship 1663 state territory shared Ukraine into right and left Hetman.</p>
<p>On the right bank shelves through Hetman Teteria tried to influence Poland, trying to restore and establish his authority there.</p>
<p>Left-Bank Cossacks fell increasingly under the sway of Moscow, which sought to put the hetman advantageous to the applicant.</p>
<p>With the support of Poland, Paul Teterya hoping to extend its authority to the Left Bank.</p>
<p>Hike the Left Bank Ukraine, which began in autumn 1663, was unsuccessful. On the Right Bank acquired antyhetmanske scope and anti-Polish uprising, which joined the Cossacks and some of the left bank of colonels.</p>
<p>Such developments complicated the situation Paul Teterya.</p>
<p>For participation in the conspiracy were arrested a year ago elected Metropolitan of Kiev and Archimandrite Joseph Tukals'kyy Holy Monastery Onufrievsky Gideon (George) Khmelnytsky, Colonel Gregory Hulyanytskoho which soon imprisoned in the former capital of Teutonic Teutonic Knights - Malbork (Mariyenburzi) and I. Vyhovsky, who was sentenced to death and executed. Squads have not added Paul Teterya popularity. The gap between him and the Cossacks deepened and actions of Polish commander Stephen Chernetsky.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, in July 1665 Teterya fled to Poland.</p>
<p>Hetman's mace was Peter Doroshenko, the final approval of which was held at the General Council in January 1666 Chyhyryn.</p>
<p><b>The power struggle in Left Bank UKRAINE.</b></p>
<p><b>Hetman Ivan BRYUHOVETSKY</b></p>
<p>On the Left Bank Ukraine in April 1662, Colonel Pereyaslav How Somko convened Kozelets officers' council.</p>
<p>Somko Council elected hetman. However, he held the position only a month for the Moscow government, not trusting Somko not recognized the legality of his election.</p>
<p>In Moscow preferred to see Hetman of Zaporozhian Ataman Ivan Briukhovetsky.</p>
<p>Having launched close ties with influential Moscow government officials, he was able to convince the king in his devotion to the throne.</p>
<p>Resorting to tricks menpleasers to influential persons easily agreeing to concessions in Ukraine's relations with Moscow, he received what had other contenders for the hetman of Left-Bank Ukraine - support the Muscovite tsar and thus military assistance.</p>
<p>Bryukhovetsky realized that no matter how big was Moscow's support, and still choose to have it hetman Cossacks. Having made the political situation, he bowed false promises to his side Sich Cossack lower classes and the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>17-18 June 1663 Nezhine assembled council, which was attended with the Cossacks peasants and urban residents. With the support of the Cossack rank and file, who strongly opposed the elders, and the pressure of Moscow Ivan Bryukhovetsky troops defeated the Somko.</p>
<p>Dostupyvshys to power Bryukhovetsky quickly denied election promises.</p>
<p>Imperious and ambitious, Bryukhovetsky refused plans to unite the Ukrainian lands under one mace. This convinces him to participate in hostilities 1663-1665 biennium.</p>
<p><b>Moscow Treaty in 1665</b></p>
<p>In its activity Ivan Bryukhovetsky relied on the support of Moscow. He made a lot of concessions to the Moscow government. In 1665 Bryukhovetsky - the first Ukrainian hetman - went to Moscow "to see the radiant eyes of the emperor."</p>
<p>There he agreed to sign a new contract.</p>
<p>Moscow governor and garrison were given the right to stay in almost all major cities.</p>
<p>Tax collection was entrusted to the Moscow governor and assembly have come fully to the royal treasury.</p>
<p>Elections Hetman could occur only with the consent of the king and in the presence of the king's representative.</p>
<p>Hetman government was deprived of the right to conduct an independent foreign policy.</p>
<p>Moscow Article substantially restrict the autonomy of the Left Bank Hetman, intensified its dependence on the Tsar.</p>
<p><b>Andrusovo CONTRACT</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Muscovy and the Commonwealth has held talks. They were ended by signing January 30, 1667 in the village. Andrus (near Smolensk) truce.</p>
<p>Military action between them (Muscovy and Poland) continued.</p>
<p>It established a truce for 13.5 years.</p>
<p>Under the rule of Muscovy remained Left-bank Ukraine, she came back Siverschyna, Smolensk and two years - Kyiv.</p>
<p>For Poland, Belarus and fixed land-bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>ZaporizhzhyaJanuary passed under the control of both countries.</p>
<p><b>Mostly Andrusovo treaty that dealt with Ukraine was signed in secret, without the consent of the Ukrainian side.</b></p>
<p>He crossed most of the achievements of the Ukrainian nation, won nearly 20-year struggle for national liberation, legitimized and secured the violent division of Ukrainian lands between Poland and Muscovy.</p>
<p><b>The consequences of the events of the late 50 - early 60's. XVII. for Ukraine</b></p>
<p>There was a civil war. For possession of hetman's mace while fighting multiple applicants from different groups of foreign policy orientation.</p>
<p>The persistent interference in Ukraine's internal affairs of other countries, the involvement of their military forces were almost continuous warfare, which resulted spustoshuvalysya whole regions destroyed already abandoned farm, people were dying en masse.</p>
<p>Cossack Ukraine lost its national independence and economic power.</p>
<p>But the most serious consequence of the period of Ukrainian history - the loss of territorial integrity of Ukraine. Dnieper, which would connect the Ukraine, divided Hetmanate in Left Bank and Right Bank.</p>
<p>Buckled Andrusiv agreement violent division of Ukrainian lands between Muscovy and Poland are extremely complicated Ukrainian liberation movement - because since then to build an independent state was necessary to overcome the resistance of the two hostile to each other, countries. Being a part of the various states under the influence of different cultures threatened to split the Ukrainian people. That is why the most important tasks of the Ukrainian derzhavtsi were voiding the contract and association Andrusovo Ukraine under the authority of the hetman.</p>
