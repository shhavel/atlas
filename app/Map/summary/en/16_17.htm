<p>Geographical maps allow us to visualize the location of objects to determine their geographic coordinates, absolute and relative height and the distance between them.</p>
<p>To determine the coordinates using the grid Degree. If an item is on the lines of degree grid, then its coordinates defined simply. For example, the city of Kharkiv latitude of 50 ° North. w., and the length of Nikolaev city is 32 ° C. d. If an item is out of line degree grid, then its coordinates determined by interpolation - comparing the distance to the closest parallels and meridians. For example, the city of Ivano-Frankivsk is located approximately equidistant between the parallels 48 ° and 50 ° North. w. So its latitude is 49 ° North. w. Longitude of Dnepropetrovsk 35 ° C. e., as the distance on the map of the city to the meridians 34 ° and 36 ° C. d. about the same.</p>
<p>As is known, to determine the distance between objects using the scale. However, the distance can be defined using degree grid. Knowing the difference of latitude or longitude in degrees objects easily determine the distance between them by multiplying the difference in distance in kilometers, which is contained in 1 degrees respectively parallel or meridian. For example, the difference in longitude between the cities of Lviv and Kharkiv is approximately 12 °. In parallel with latitude 50 ° North. w., both of which are located near the city, 1 degree corresponds to 71.7 km (these values ​​are signed in parallels the eastern frame cards). By simple calculations we calculate the distance between Lviv and Kharkiv is approximately 860 km. The difference of latitude between the cities of Kyiv and Odessa is approximately 4 ° (50,5 ° North. W. - Kyiv latitude minus 46,5 ° North. W. - Latitude Odessa). It is known that 1 degree meridian corresponds to approximately 111.3 miles, so the distance between Kyiv and Odessa is about 450 km.</p>
<p>Physical map makes it possible to determine the height shown in her projects. The absolute height of many objects are marked on the map the numbers of black and deep seas - blue. Analyzing the physical map of Ukraine, determines that the highest peak in our country - Goverla has a height of 2061 m above sea level, the highest peak of the Crimean mountains - Mount Roman-Kosh - height of 1545 m. However, in order to determine the absolute height of any areas need colors that reflect topography, compare with the scale heights and depths. For example, on this map the outskirts of Kyiv painted colors that match the height from 50 m to 200 m, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya - up to 50 m, Ternopil and Khmelnitsky - from 300 m to 500 m.</p>
