<p>For centuries, Africa has been a major supplier of slaves and raw materials.</p>
<p>Although over time the situation is gradually changing, but today most of the continent is underdeveloped, and such as Sudan, Eritrea, Central African Republic, Chad, Niger is particularly underdeveloped. On their background of significant progress in economic development reached Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Zambia, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo others. And the example of South Africa - the only developed country of the continent - is an exception to the general rule. This can be explained by the fact that the southern part of the continent due to its geographical location and the presence of large mineral resources (gold, coal, diamonds, uranium ore) attracted his time to his European colonists. They, along with hopes for a rapid enrichment brought to an advanced management skills, and greatly influenced the lifestyle and mentality Alaska. Today, South Africa is the undisputed leader continental. Share of PA's GDP is 60% of the continent, the country accounts for half of manufacturing industry and the car park in Africa. And for some items the country - among the world leaders (to 3/4 of proven reserves of diamonds are concentrated here).</p>
<p>Egypt and neighboring countries have been successful primarily due to its proximity to Europe - one of the centers of the world economy, and the ability to quickly integrate into the world economy. Also characteristic of this region is the presence of large deposits of gas and oil, as well as a tourist attraction.</p>
<p>West African countries have also made some progress in the economy. Thanks to its convenient location, the availability of ports they have the opportunity to lead a busy trade and attract investment into its economy. But even among these countries, many of which are actually suppliers of raw materials and agricultural products to developed countries. This is especially characteristic of Congo (crude petroleum), Niger (uranium ore), Liberia (iron ore), Senegal, Chad.</p>
<p>So, for Africa as a whole is characterized by a low level of economic development. The majority of the continent has a long and difficult path to prosperity. The share in world GDP (less than 5%) huge continent with a population of over 800 million people just ahead of Australia, whose area is four, and the population is ten times lower than the corresponding figure of the black continent.</p>
