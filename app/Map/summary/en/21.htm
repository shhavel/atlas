<p>Forest and timber industry combines harvesting and processing of timber and other forest resources and consists of logging, woodworking, pulp and paper and resin industries.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the map, the industry concentrated in the northern and western regions of the state, near the source of raw materials - woods. Other criteria facility location - availability of electricity, water (pulp and paper company) and the proximity of markets (Furniture Manufacture) .With regard to the above, it is logical pattern placement industry. Forestry concentrated in forested areas Polesie and the Carpathians. Woodworking (sawmill, plywood, furniture, manufacture of particle board, matches) presented in Lviv, Drohobych Kostopol, March. Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Chernivtsi has a powerful Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The largest pulp and paper company located in Zhydachev, Ponintsi, raspberries, Dnepropetrovsk, Koryukovka (paper) Rahov, Obukhov (cardboard).</p>
<p>Resin industry is a supplier of market-resin, acetic acid, turpentine and is represented by Svalyavy and New Places.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the main tracts of forest are located in the Carpathians, in Polesie and in the mountains of Crimea. Forest in Ukraine is just over 14%, and 9/10 of the entire logging accounts for the Carpathians and Polesie.</p>
<p>Availability of Ukraine's own forest resources is only 25-30% because more than 22 million m3 of timber annually imported from abroad. However, significant amounts of the most valuable species (mainly of the Carpathians) are exported abroad.</p>
<p>Environmental pollution, inefficient use of waste timber - the main problem area. In addition, most of the forest resources of Ukraine is in the public domain, that, according to international experience, is not an effective tool for forestry management. However, the weakening of state control over the use of forest resources entails serious consequences. Uncontrolled deforestation has caused landslides, which caused grave consequences of the flooding in the western regions of the state in the summer of 2008.</p>
