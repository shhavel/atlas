<p>The main forms of the earth's surface is plain games.</p>
<p>Rivnyny- this land area, having a flat surface. The plains are divided into lowland ivysochyny.</p>
<p>The lowlands are marked on the map in green and yellow hills and light brown.</p>
<p>In northern Ukraine, located Plain Woodland. The surface of the marsh, mostly of low rise - hills. In the northeast it continues Dnieper Lowland. The area is hilly with lots of ravines and gullies. Because it seems to wavy surface. South Black Sea Ukraine occupies lowland.</p>
<p>In Ukraine there are hills, Volyn, Podolia, Dnieper Donetsk and Azov. It is also plain. But they sometimes increase reaching about 500 m. Often there are ravines and gullies.</p>
<p>Thus, the plains are hills, ravines and gullies.</p>
<p>Jar - is a large recess with steep slopes on Earth.</p>
<p>How it is formed? Tala or rainwater on the slopes of a hill or sloping terrain flowing stream. From this motivated initially formed small groove. Over the years it hlybshaye and turns into a ravine.</p>
<p>After many years of steep ravines overgrown plants and ravines are converted into beams.</p>
<p>Horizon is the surface area of ​​the earth, lifted high above the plains.</p>
<p>On Earth, isolated mountains are rare. Often they are drawn series. Several mountains are called mountain ranges. Between the mountain ranges are picturesque valleys, flowing turbulent mountain rivers.</p>
<p>Depending on the height of the mountains are low, medium and high. The low height of the mountain is from 500 to 800 m. The height of medium mountains - from 800 to 2000 m. Tall mountains over 2,000 meters high called.</p>
<p>In the western part of Ukraine stretches the Carpathian Mountains. Height they are mean mountains with rounded peaks. Only the highest peak of the Carpathians - Goverla - has a height of 2061 m.</p>
<p>On the Crimean peninsula Crimean mountains towering arch. their highest peak - Mount Roman-Kosh -zavvyshky 1545 m.</p>
<p>Sources, rivers, lakes, marshes, seas, ponds and reservoirs - a reservoir land. If they occur in nature, they are called natural, man--shtuchnymy.</p>
<p>Source - a place where the surface of the earth flowing underground water.</p>
<p>Some rain and melt water seeps into the ground. It easily passes through soil and sand, but delayed clay. There, the water is collected in underground lakes. In places where the clay comes to the surface of the earth, the water flows to the surface. Power generated at the bottom of ravines, gullies, on slopes of hills, steep river banks. Spring water is cold and clean. After it passes through a layer of sand and cleaned of impurities.</p>
<p>Rivers of Ukraine</p>
<p>Each river has leaked - the place where it starts. Leaks can be a source, lake, swamp or ice in mountains. Some streams merge and give rise to the river. On its way it takes the water to other rivers - their tributaries. Burying through which the river flows is called a channel. The place where the river empties into another body of water - is her mouth. The rivers flowing into lakes, seas, oceans and other rivers.</p>
<p>Each river has left and right banks. To define them, you stand facing in the direction of flow. To the right is the right bank and left - left.</p>
<p>One of the great plains of rivers of Ukraine is the Dnieper. Most of its tributaries - Pripyat, Desna, Psyol Vorskla, Samara. Dnieper River originates in Russia, flows through Belarus. But it is the widest and longest in Ukraine. Majestic Dnieper its waters from north to south. The banks of the Dnieper River and its tributaries are extremely picturesque.</p>
<p>In the south of the country completes its way povnovoda river Danube. It crosses on its way many European countries.</p>
<p>Dniester rises in the Carpathians. It flows through the western part of Ukraine. During rain or melting snow in the mountains, this mountain stream becomes very violent and out of the banks.</p>
<p>Among the major rivers in Ukraine are also Southern Bug and the Seversky Donets.</p>
<p>Lakes and swamps Ukraine</p>
<p>Lake - a body of water that occurs in natural hollows on the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>Lakes are large and small, deep and shallow, fresh or salt water. Lakes with running water flows, and the drainage - just received. The lakes are replenished with water rivers, underground springs, rain and melt water.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, about 20 thousand lakes. They form the Lake District. Abundant for Woodland Lake Plain. There is a famous Shatsky Lakes, among them - the lake Svitjaz.</p>
<p>In the Carpathians, most lakes are small but deep. The water in them is fresh, pure and cold. Mountain Lake striking beauty. Especially famous lake Sinevir.</p>
<p>In the Podolsk Upland lakes are small and shallow. In summer they are well heated. Near them grow a variety of plants and animals live.</p>
<p>Many lakes formed by the river Danube. The largest fresh water lake including -Yalpuh and deepest -Kahul.</p>
<p>On the coast of the Black Sea is a lake-estuary of the salt water. Salt Lake rich Crimea. The most famous - Siwash Lake, which is mined table salt. Many Crimean lakes dry up in summer.</p>
<p>Gradually, lakes, especially shallow, zamulyuyutsya, overgrown plants and eventually turn into a swamp.</p>
<p>Swamp - area too damp earth's surface. It grow moisture-loving plants.</p>
<p>In swamps and can turn a piece of land, where stagnant water after rains, flooding, melting snow.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the largest wetlands on Polisskiy lowlands.</p>
<p>Sea - a part of the ocean that cuts into the land.</p>
<p>All sea connected to the oceans. The water in the seas salty-bitter.</p>
<p>In the south Ukraine is washed by the Black Sea. In the south-west - the Sea of ​​Azov. It is a sea of ​​the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The Black Sea is connected to the Sea of ​​Azov by the Kerch Strait. Black Sea deep and warm, its average depth is 1256 m and the highest - 2245 m. In the summer the water temperature is + 22 ° ... + 25 ° C, and in winter + 6 ° ... + 8 ° C. In the Black Sea flowing almost all the major rivers in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Sea of ​​Azov is less than Black. It is very shallow. Its maximum depth - 15 m. In the summer in the Azov Sea water is heated to 30 ° C, but in winter it freezes.</p>
