<p>The study of geography is impossible without a map, which contains the most accurate and objective information about uncluttered area, location of natural, economic or social objects and phenomena.</p>
<p>On this map more completely than others Atlas represented geographic features (islands, peninsulas, bays, straits, seas, etc.). Physical map provides an overview of the major landforms of land and seabed. It presents orographic name (landforms): mountains, plains, some peaks with their absolute height above sea level, and the names of landforms ocean floor - troughs, ridges, valleys and so on.</p>
<p>Hydrographic maps provided the basis freshwater and salt lakes, waterfalls, rivers, which makes it possible to draw conclusions about the economic use of water land. Thanks trends shown can draw conclusions about differences in climate within the climatic zones. Also shown deserts, wetlands, salt marshes spread, sand, active volcanoes and signed the names of geographical regions (Llanos, Selvas etc.).</p>

<p>Comparing this map with the map of Mineral Resources, you can trace the relationship landforms spread of minerals of different origin (sedimentary, igneous, etc.).</p>
<p>This map is useful in the preparation of the characteristics of natural resources as well as in the regional survey in the evaluation of natural resource potential.</p>
