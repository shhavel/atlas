<p><b>Basic concepts and terms</b></p>
<p>Ancient Slavs - a group of tribes belonging to the Indo-European community - ancestors of the Slavic peoples of Eastern, Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>The Slavs - a large group of European nations united by common language and proximity origin. In the default language regarding the division of the eastern (Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian), western (Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Sorbs) and southern (Bulgarians, Macedonians, Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians, Montenegrins, Serbs). Slavic languages ​​belong to the Indo-European language family.</p>
<p>Migration - grand ethnic migration, which took place in Europe at 4.6 cent. Caused by Hun invasion Migration caused the formation of a series of barbarian kingdoms - Goths, Vandals, Burgundians, Franks, Lombards and others. A large settlement of peoples led to the so-called Great settlement of the Slavs.</p>
<p>A large settlement of the Slavs took place in Europe in the 6-7 cent., When Slavic tribes appear in the Danube, in the deep areas of the Balkans - in the south, west to reach the Elbe and the Baltic coast; the northeast occupy the top of the Don and Volga. Due to the large settlement of the Slavs was initiated separation Slavic ethnic group that initiated the formation of the Slavic peoples.</p>
<p>Byzantium, the Byzantine Empire - the state that existed in the eastern part of the Roman Empire from the end of 4 to mid-15th century. Got its name from the ancient colony on the shores of the Bosphorus - Byzantium, the site of the emperor Constantine in 330. Established the state capital - Constantinople. Byzantium was considered the successor to the Roman Empire, as the Byzantines called themselves Romans - "Romeo" and their country "romeyskoyu." The official language in Article 4.6. was Latin, and Greek.</p>
<p>Gauthier - the general name of ethno-political union of Germanic tribes first half of the first millennium AD. Immigrants from Scandinavia, which at the beginning of our era, migrated to the Baltic states, and later moved to the southeast up to the Black and Azov Seas. It created a tribal alliance, the so-called Gothic State defeated the Huns in the 5th century.</p>
<p>Huns - Turkic-speaking people who prykochuvav in the steppes of the Ukraine territory of Mongolia and China, replacing Iranian nomads, and opened the era of the Great Migration, during which largely formed modern ethnic map of Europe.</p>
<p>Avars - a great alliance of nomadic Turkic tribes. In the 6th century. came from Asia through Ukrainian territory on the Danube and established their own state Avar khanate.</p>
<p>Venedi - ancient Slavic name under which they are mentioned in ancient sources and Art. and the oldest Slavic etnopleminne. At that time, the Veneti occupied the land between the north of the Pripyat, Vistula in the west and south of Middle TN, without a clear definition of the eastern borders.</p>
<p>Anti - etnopleminne ancient Slavs, which occupied the territory between the Dniester and Dnieper. Archaeological Ants are penkivska culture. In the 6th century. anti with other Slavic tribes were actively involved in the colonization of the Balkans, the Slavs in wars against Byzantium. Last record of 602 dates from Ants. In connection with a campaign Avar punitive squad for their extermination. However, archaeological materials indicate that the settlement Ants and their descendants there and after that - for all 7 of art. Together with other groups of early anti involved in the ethnogenesis of eastern, western and southern Slavs.</p>
<p>Sklavyny - etnopleminne old Slavic, which occupied the territory between the Dniester and the Danube. Archaeological sklavyniv is Prague-korchatska culture.</p>
<p><b>Chronology</b></p>
<p>4-6 c. - Migration</p>
<p>6-7 c. - A large settlement of Slavs</p>
<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. Real Slavic Attractions</b></p>
<p>Slavic origins, archaeologists have yet to see the farming tribes of steppe that they had to guard against militant Cimmerians.</p>
<p>But it would be wrong to say allegedly chornoliska population - slaves. This is only the origin of some signs of spiritual life, welfare and economy inherent in later times Slavs.</p>
<p>Century after century - and the archaeological cultures of the steppe Ukraine becomes more such features, allowing researchers to call our land Slavs originated.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, however, that under conditions of constant change habitats for different peoples, as so often in ancient times, the ancestors of the Slavs and a diver, capturing large areas and living there together with other people.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that many scientists associated with the origin of the Slavs wider territory - from the Oder to the Dnieper.</p>
<p><b>Features artifacts of ancient Slavs</b></p>
<p>The settlements of the ancient Slavs settled groups in close proximity to each other on the banks of rivers.</p>
<p>For housing in their regulations napivzemlyanky dugout or a braided composite with felled trunks and walls of fire, and from the 5th century. n. e. - with a stone oven on the floor.</p>
<p>The dead odnoplementsiv Slav Slavs mostly burned.</p>
<p>Ceramic sculpted hands, without pottery wheel, occasionally ozdoblyuyuchy different patterns.</p>
<p><b>Since the beginning of the 1st millennium. BC. e. number of Slavic sites steadily increased, but still no luck archaeologists discover archaeological culture to 5 cc., which would completely Slavonic or Slavic tribes.</b></p>
<p>By the 5th century. Slavic monuments were part of the archeological culture along with other nations. So, on the verge er distinguish them in two cultures: Zarubynec'k, which included the territories of Ukraine and Belarus, and Przewor, widespread in Poland.</p>
<p>In Zarubynec'k Slavic culture are major attractions in the presence of Baltic and Germanic. In Przewor are insignificant next to the main Germanic-Celtic.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century. n. e. in Ukraine with Slavic tribes originated Slavic culture, which covered the ground between Pripyat and Desna in the north and the Black Sea and the Danube in the south. Along with its Slavic tribes created the Goths, Scythians, Sarmatians, Thracians and others.</p>
<p>Actually Slavic archaeological culture in the steppe of South-Eastern Europe faced in a 5-6 c. n. e.</p>
<p><b>2. Written sources about the Slavs</b></p>
<p>Inhabiting remote from the turbulence of contemporary European history and territories without their own written language, the Slavs came relatively late to the pages of books.</p>
<p>The earliest evidence of them belong to the new era. They belong to the Roman historian 1-2 tbsp. Pliny the Elder, Tacitus and geographer Ptolemy (2 c.).</p>
<p>All three were called Veneti Slavs and spoke of them as separate people who lived east of the Vistula river, surrounded by the Germans, Thracians, Sarmatians, Balts.</p>
<p>According to archaeologists, it wends meet Zarubynets'ka and Slavic archaeological culture in Slavonic their part.</p>
<p>Ptolemy, among others, among tribes also called wends stavaniv. This title sees some linguists distorted synonymous "Slavs".</p>
<p>General evidence of Roman historians - doling out the facts and very controversial.</p>
<p>More talk about the Slavs source 6. and later centuries. Great attention to them, in particular, paid by the history of the Goths Jordan in his book "On the Origin and act Goths" (another name of the book - "deve lopment") 551. "These Veneti derived from the same root and is now known by three names: Veneti, Antes sklavyniv ... "- said Jordan of the Slavs.</p>
<p>The names "sklavyny" and "anti" to the Slavs along with the name "Veneti" there and elsewhere. They confirm the division of the ancient Slavs in various tribal associations. Yes, Jordan, Veneti lived in the Vistula, anti - in the Dnieper, sklavyny between the Dniester and the Danube.</p>
<p>According to archaeologists, it was another tribal union of the Slavs, who lived in the upper reaches of the Dnieper. Due to the remoteness of the tribes of the Roman-Byzantine world, their name, albeit conditional, not preserved.</p>
<p>On the origin of the names of uzhyvaly Slavs ancient historians strangers, Ukrainian scientists share the opinion: two of them - Veneti and anti - there are other language (first - Germanic, the second - of Iranian origin); Third, sklavyny - modified self "Slavs". So ethnonym "Slavs" is used in the sources of 6.</p>
<p><b>3. Social Life</b></p>
<p>Archaeological finds no objection to this evidence, but rather - insist that the Slavs from the very beginning of its history acted as separate, though related, larger or smaller groups - union families - the tribes, tribal unions.</p>
<p>Tribes led by elected community leaders. Leaders elected from among the natives of the richest families.</p>
<p>That the leaders at Caesar, the powers which belonged redistribution of products produced, the organization of defense in time of war events, military equipment etc. wives. Government leaders later became hereditary.</p>
<p>When demand appeared strong guard against the enemy, Slavic tribes united in major military alliances. An example of such a union can be antske association.</p>
<p><b>The formation of large tribal scientists believe this level of social relations that preceded the state. Thus, the ancient Slavs in 5-7 centuries. uprytul approached the creation of the state.</b></p>
<p>About peredderzhavnyy level of public relations in the ancient Slavs shows the arrangement of their settlements. Smaller settlements larger skupchuvalysya around - sort of breeding centers.</p>
<p>The latter were also manufacturing center. Subsequently, large settlements turned into fortified settlement.</p>
<p>The remains of the great Slavic tribal center, archaeologists have found, for example, in Volyn - it Zimne mound.</p>
<p>Relatively complex social relationships among the Slavs, the formation of their tribal leadership - Elite - 6 tablespoons sources indicate.</p>
<p>For example, one of them warns that in many Slavic leaders. Another author, already mentioned Gothic historian Jordan spoke about the massacre of the Gothic king Bozhem Slavic leader, his supporters and 70 children-elders.</p>
<p>Not contradict the stories of ancient historians and archaeological treasures of the Slavic territories ruled for life, certainly the richest and empowered representatives of the Slavic tribes.</p>
<p>Among these attractions and Martynivskyy treasure that scientists assumed, belonged to someone with antskyh leaders.</p>
<p>Much evidence points to a special role in the life of the Slavs joint councils, which were adopted important decisions. "These tribes, and anti sklavyny not be one person - wrote in the 6th century. Procopius of Caesarea, - and for a long time living in a democracy, so all that is useful for them or bad, they heed together. "</p>
<p><b>4. Facilities ancient Slavs</b></p>
<p>Ancient Slavs lived from agriculture and cattle settled.</p>
<p>They grew millet, barley, wheat, rye, oats, flax and hemp, preferring spring varieties.</p>
<p>Sow winter crops taught in the second half of the 1 thousand.</p>
<p>The animals bred great and small cattle, sheep, pigs and horses.</p>
<p>Living among forests in the land of rivers and lakes, Slavs ignored thousands of years of hunting and fishing experiences.</p>
<p>Among the handicrafts made of special casting and forging.</p>
<p>Among the blacksmiths ancient Slavs especially revered master jewelers.</p>
<p>Kind of the Slavs was the production of pottery.</p>
<p>For a long time, even after other nations had borrowed wheel, pottery, especially one that was used for cooking, remained stucco.</p>
<p>Flourishing pottery production took place in our lands for 3-4 centuries. - At times Cherniahivs'ka culture.</p>
<p>During the Great Migration pottery declined, so the pottery to the Slavs before the stucco up to 10-11 century.</p>
<p>The development of trade indicated by numerous finds of coins of different nations. Slavs gladly traded with a population of Danube, central Europe and the Baltic states, and later - with the inhabitants of the Roman and Byzantine ancient cities and provinces Northern Black Sea.</p>
<p>In Slavic lands at that time fell tableware, glassware, bronze, silver and gold, wine, oil.</p>
<p>Instead exported furs, honey, wax, hides, grain.</p>
<p>In 6-7 centuries. Slavic tribes Podneprovye controlled the trade routes Dnipro, the Baltic and Black Sea.</p>
<p><b>5. Slavs during the Great Migration</b></p>
<p>Settling Ants and sklavyniv occurred at a time known in history as the Great Migration. Over by him, the Slavs were actively involved in military events, gaining experience in public life, which subsequently implemented in their own countries.</p>
<p><b>Under the rule of the Goths and Huns</b></p>
<p>In the 3rd century. Goths finally established in the Black Sea steppes. Their state united many nations of those lands, including Slavs, Antes.</p>
<p>Gothic domination fell during the invasion of the Huns. With the support of anti overcame the Goths.</p>
<p>As part of Hun association Slavs making a way to the Danube and the Balkans, acting then as allies nomads, as their subordinates.</p>
<p>The greatest power of the Huns under Attila at the time of, and after his death in 453. Fast weak.</p>
<p>Freed depending on the Huns, Slavs powerful stream of earth moved to Byzantium. Thus began large settlement of the Slavs.</p>
<p><b>Slavs military campaigns against Byzantium.</b></p>
<p><b>Resettlement of the Balkan Peninsula</b></p>
<p>First independent trips Slavs on Byzantium held at the end of the beginning of 5- 6.</p>
<p>Almost every year there Slavic military expedition to the Balkans by the Emperor Justinian (527-565 gg.).</p>
<p>But after going 550-551's. The mass migration of Slavs, Antes the Balkans. Contemporary sources suggest that before you lay the village, slaves carried out military operations during which ruined fortress.</p>
<p>At the end of 6. permanent Slavic settlements occur everywhere in the Balkans.</p>
<p><b>Therefore the result of military campaigns against the Byzantine Empire was the resettlement of Slavic tribes in the land of the Balkan Peninsula.</b></p>
<p>At the end of 6. Ants in relations with Byzantium intervened Avars - a nomadic people of Turkic origin, who made their country - Khanate - the Middle Danube.</p>
<p>The need to counter accidents prompted former rivals to unite.</p>
<p>Year 601 anti Byzantium were against the Avars, the side of which, however, fought sklavyny.</p>
<p>Next year Avars made another expedition against the Ants.</p>
<p>Contemporary sources are silent about who won. However, the name of Ants 602. No longer mentioned.</p>
<p>It is believed that the powerful military alliance antskyy collapsed, and for the Slavic tribes that were part of it, a new phase in their history - the life of the Balkan lands, surrounded by other people, which gave rise to the modern South nations.</p>
<p><b>Slavic tribes settling on the Danube</b></p>
<p>Archaeological sites indicate that the migration flow of the Danube and the Balkans were not only anti and part sklavynskyh tribes.</p>
<p>When anti seized lands Balkans oselyayuchys there often with accidents and Bulgarians, sklavyny moved to the banks of the Danube, paving his way up the Danube to the west.</p>
<p>Eventually they moved up to the top of the Elbe, mixed with Slavic tribes that moved there from Poland, and surrounded by Germanic tribes gave rise to the modern West Slavic peoples.</p>
<p><b>Note!</b></p>
<p><b>Division Slavs in western, eastern and southern meets modern Slavs. As pointed researchers in 8-9 centuries. there was neither east nor west, nor south Slavic community, but were eastern, western and southern Slavic tribes or their unions, on which stood many Slavic nations.</b></p>
<p><b>Resettlement to the north. The origin of the modern nations of East</b></p>
<p>Already mentioned that in the upper reaches of the Dnieper, the Left, in the 5-7 century. also inhabited by Slavic tribes. Their lives are verified by archaeological finds, but the name of the tribes did not survive.</p>
<p>Ancient Slavs - the inhabitants of the Upper Dnieper - Byzantine authors paid attention because their families did not participate in expeditions to the south.</p>
<p>Living next to the Baltic population, they were involved in the events center of which stood the Baltic.</p>
<p>Gradually these tribes settled in the far north.</p>
<p>Those who advanced in a north-westerly direction, then gave life to the people of Belarus. Those who went to the northeast, were the ancestors of the Russians.</p>
<p><b>6. The origins of the Ukrainian people</b></p>
<p>For a long time science was suggested that the Ukrainian ancestors were anti.</p>
<p>However, the latest archeological findings prove that the monuments later time, which is the proper Ukrainian, appeared not only on the basis antskyh sites, and mostly based on landmarks that were left sklavyny.</p>
<p>Because it sklavyny were the population, which lived 5-7 centuries. in most of the Ukrainian Right Bank.</p>
<p>Anti, whom sources say that they lived in the Dnieper, from 6. began to move south, on the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Part antskoyi population that did not participate in resettlement sklavynamy was absorbed, and in memory of Ants on the territory remained Podniprov'ya name, which, according to many researchers owe their ethnonym modern Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Iranian word "anti" means "extreme", "marginal". He steppe Scythian and Sarmatian tribes have always called borderlands of the steppes local farming population. Millennial proximity to the Iranian people entrenching the title, which, however, local residents voiced differently. It appeared, according to some historians and linguists, the name of Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>So great migration of peoples was of great importance for the future of the Slavs. Picked up by him, Slavic tribes intermingled and new territories gave the beginnings of modern Slavic peoples.</b></p>
