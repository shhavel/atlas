<p>From learned in previous classes and their own life experiences you know that the earth's surface is uneven. On Earth, there are mountains, plateaus, hills and hollows. All the irregularities of the earth's surface is called the relief. For a more complete image area on the maps, it is necessary to image the relief. To properly portray the relief is necessary to know the absolute and relative heights of objects. The absolute height - the height of the object above sea level, taken as 0 m. In our country, for the origin of height accepted level of the Baltic Sea. Relative height - the excess of one object over another. For example the absolute height of the highest peak in Ukraine, mountains Hoverla is 2061 m above sea level. However, its relative height from bottom to top, is much less, because the foot is well above sea level.</p>
<p>In terms of terrain and a topographic map depicting terrain using contour lines - lines connecting points of equal area with altitude. One horizontal not provide information about landforms, need several horizontal. They are held at regular intervals of height, depending on the map scale. These intervals can be 1 m, 2.5 m, 5 m, etc. The top point and point to indicate its absolute height. For contour can determine the nature of the relief: the closer horizontally arranged from one another, the steeper the slope, and vice versa. The direction of the slope indicate short lines - berhshtryhamy. They are placed near the contour, the free end downward relief.</p>
<p>In addition to image contours using hypsometric relief or painting in layers: the lower or higher above sea level, the darker the color. Traditionally, a yellow-brown palette to display the topography of land and blue-violet - for the relief of the seabed. The degree of the scale should clearly be distinguished, but not be too dramatic. Successfully completed in layers of color, creating the effect of convexity relief map, does not complicate the perception of its content.</p>
<p>Major landforms include mountains and upland plains. For the absolute height of the mountain are: low - up to 1000 m, average - from 1000 to 2000 meters and high - more than 2000 m.</p>
<p>In the mountains, isolated individual peaks, ridges, consisting of interconnected mountains and mountain valleys - reduction between mountain ranges. The narrow mountain valleys and deep gorges called. All plains are divided into lowland (altitude of less than 200 m) hill - from 200 to 500 m and the plateau - 500 m. Lots of land, located below sea level, known as depressions.</p>
<p>elyef the ocean floor also varied. Major landforms include: shelf - flooded coastal mainland from as deep as 200 m; continental slope, which quickly dropped to a depth of 2000 m; ocean floor - depth of the bottom. In the bed of the ocean is dominated by deep-sea plains, but often there are also underwater ridges, deep sea trenches and volcanoes with flat tops. Seamounts that reach the ocean surface to form islands. The largest seamounts formed at the boundaries of lithospheric plates. They are called mid-ocean ridges, reaching up to 2000 m height and extend for thousands of kilometers.</p>
