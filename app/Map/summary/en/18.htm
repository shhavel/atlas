<p>One of the most advanced heavy industries Ukraine are ferrous metallurgy. Iron, steel and rolled metal, ferro-alloys, tubes - products industry. The presence in Ukraine of large deposits of iron and manganese ores (respectively 5% and 20% of world reserves), coking coal, refractory clay, fluxing materials caused the formation of a strong metallurgical base. Most of the material is concentrated in the Dnieper and Donets Basin, together with the presence of the consumer (metal-mechanical engineering), developed transport network and considerable manpower resulted in placing the industry in Dnipro, Donetsk and Azov areas.</p>
<p>The main centers of the steel industry is Dnepropetrovsk, Krivoy Rog, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Mariupol, Alchevs'k, Khartsyzk. As can be seen from the map Metallurgy, and the number of placed businesses and the region's share in the production industry is dominated Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye region. In general, for the production of iron and manganese ore, iron and steel Ukraine - among the world leaders. While exports of steel products to the state is a major source of foreign currency. The main problems the industry is pollution, the need for technical re-equipment of production and improve the quality of metals.</p>
<p>Another component of the sector - non-ferrous metallurgy - compared to less developed black. Lack of raw materials, the need for significant enrichment of raw energy - water consumption and production - the main characteristics of the industry. The leading component industry - aluminum industry is represented Mykolayiv Alumina Plant (running on imported raw materials), Zaporozhye aluminum plant and Sverdlovsk (Lugansk region) factory aluminum alloys. Smaller volumes with production of zinc, magnesium, titanium, ferronickel, mercury, gold. The industry located in Donetsk and Dnipro regions of ferrous metallurgy. Perspective is the Carpathian region, where proven reserves of gold, aluminum and polymetallic ores.</p>
