<p>Facilities of Ukrainian lands in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>1. Agriculture and agrarian relations in Dnieper Ukraine</p>
<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century. Dnieper Ukraine's economy remained agricultural in nature. in its agricultural sector employed about 95% in early and 89% of the population in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>About 75% of all arable land was in private ownership landlords. The main agricultural producers, farmers, who in their legal position were divided into two main groups:</p>
<p>landed peasants or serfs were in personal dependence on landlords and were attached to their estates. Serfs outnumbered the Right Bank;</p>
<p>state peasants belonging to the treasury officially called free rural inhabitants. "They were personally free and conducted farm. State peasants dominated the South and the Left.</p>
<p>The number of farmers in the population of the Dnieper to the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Right bank, state peasants - 22%, landed peasants - 20%, the rest of the population - 58%</p>
<p>Left Bank: state peasants - 35% of landed peasants - 53%, the rest of the population - 12%</p>
<p>South: The state peasants - 25% of landed peasants - 24%, the rest of the population - 51%</p>
<p>The main form of exploitation of serfs was the corvee or labor rent. State peasants paying cash rent, paying a quarter of their earnings as a tax to the state. The Russian government has formally limited to 1797 serfdom 3 days a week. However, landlords evaded the law by using task system, when one day serfdom was given the task ("Lesson"), which may be executed only 2-3 days. Landowners practicing farmers as translation for "mesyachinu" when farmers received for their continued serfdom monthly maintenance nature.</p>
<p>Suffered by peasants and landless. The growth in demand for agricultural products caused that holders of estates increased the number of landed estates as their sources of income, and had been reducing the size of rural divisions.</p>
<p>By increasing exploitation of serfs, serfs to the short period of increased profits. However, the poverty of the peasants, the decline of their economies, lack of incentives for better work, inability to use new technology made the inevitable decline of the landed estates. In 30-40-ies. The nineteenth century. After a brief heyday of feudal economy were in crisis. In southern Ukraine, where the most widely use hired labor agriculture developed rapidly.</p>
<p>The deployment process tovaryzatsiyi agricultural production led to stratification of the peasants. Rapidly it unfolded among state peasants Bank and South. In particular, in the province Ekaterinoslavskoy peasant proprietors concentrated in the hands of 18% of the private land. Have you seen some wealthy farmers who owned or leased 100 more acres of land. The imperial government supported state peasants. There were equalized in rights of the citizens to acquire land, allowed to organize factories.</p>
<p>The process unfolded as a bundle of serfs. They were allowed to buy land in the name of his landlord, use of employees, to establish enterprises for processing agricultural products. However, their legal status remained unchanged, and the landlord could ever take away all their belongings.</p>
<p>Deteriorating conditions fortress turned into a source of social instability. "It is dangerous and this danger is to hide the crime, - informed the chief of police Benckendorf O. Nicholas II - The people no longer one that was 25 years ago. Generally serfdom is powder keg under power. Ever and something you need to start and start slowly - than to wait until the start of the bottom of the people. "However, trying to solve the peasant question the imperial government wary displeasure of the landowners who believed his actions interference in their affairs.</p>

<p>2. The beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Dnieper Ukraine</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution - the process of development of the productive forces of society in which the transition from manufacturing to machine production.</p>
<p>In the 30's. The nineteenth century. Dnieper started the Industrial Revolution. Manufactory of Ukrainian lands in the Russian Empire were feudal enterprise based on the forced labor of serfs. Therefore, the transition to the manufacturing industry, which was based on wage labor caused this gradual destruction of serfdom.</p>
<p>The number of factories declined and factories increased. in 1825 in the Dnieper were about 650 enterprises manufacturing industry, and in 1861 there were already 2330. Particularly rapid process of new enterprises was held in textile industry. From 1805 to 1859 the number of enterprises in the Dnieper cloth increased from 27 to 160. The main center of the textile industry was the s. Klyptsi in Chernihiv, where in 1860 there were 9 woolen mills. Rapidly developed coal industry. By the mid-nineteenth century. Donbass is the second largest (after the Silesian Basin in Poland) in Empire Centre coal industry. New enterprises also appeared in the sugar industry. By the mid-nineteenth century. Naddnipryaschyna provide over 80% of General-sugar production. The glory of the first Ukrainian Sugar got to Yahnenko and F. Semyrenko.</p>
<p>The first machines for plants and factories were imported from abroad, mainly through the port of Odessa. In 40-50-ies. Enterprises producing industrial equipment emerged in Kiev, Yekaterynoslav, Romny near Lugansk and other cities. In 1861 in the Dnieper were about 20 mechanical plants.</p>
<p>Along with the formation of the manufacturing industry formed new social strata, entrepreneurs and wage industrial workers. Among the owners of factories majority were Russians. Framing of industrial workers prevented the existence of serfdom. The sources of its formation were impoverished state peasants, ruined urban artisans and released on the rent serfs, who gave some of their earnings as cash rents landlords.</p>
<p>The number of industrial workers in Dnieper Ukraine (thous. People)</p>
<p>1800 - 10.0</p>
<p>1825 - 15.0</p>
<p>1846 - 51.7</p>
<p>1853 - 61.7</p>
<p>1860 - 86.7</p>
<p>The situation of workers of most factories were extremely difficult. Working day reached 15 hours, real wages were meager, and the conditions of life - just awful. Many workers became crippled and died due to lack of safety and health care.</p>
<p>3. The state of the economy and the nature of economic relations at Western</p>
<p>Western areas of the level of economic development is much inferior to other regions of the Habsburg Empire. The basis of the province's economy was agriculture. In Eastern Galicia dominated agriculture. During the first half of the nineteenth century. increased in the land of landless peasants. During this time, the average size of peasant holdings decreased from 6 to 4 hectares, and land holdings of landlords increased from 400 to 600 hectares. Arable farming was extensive in nature, and therefore - low yields. Under these conditions, natural disasters and crop failures caused famine in the countryside in 1805, 1817, 1829, 1844-1847 gg. In this case, the same year the grain of the landed estates exported to other provinces of the empire and abroad.</p>
<p>Landholdings in Western Ukraine in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Region and the fate of the entire earth which had landlords</p>
<p>Eastern Galicia - 96%</p>
<p>Northern Bukovina - 69%</p>
<p>Transcarpathia - 90%</p>
<p>In Transcarpathia most arable land used for industrial viticulture, horticulture and agriculture. The vast majority of land belonged to the Hungarian and German landowners, state and monasteries. The small peasant holdings could not provide their owners with food. This forced the peasants to go to work in other parts of the empire. The farm land of mountainous regions played an important role livestock and logging. Transcarpathian wool and wood came from there to the Hungarian and Austrian markets. The peasants suffered from landlessness, and about half of it had no land. Most of the farmers are constantly starving. Almost every year thousands of peasants died of starvation.</p>
<p>In most of northern Bukovina leading role in agriculture sector has played, and in mountainous areas - livestock, logging and hunting. Actual owners in the region were large landowners, who owned two-thirds of arable land and most of the villages.</p>
<p>The vast majority of western peasants were serfs and was in a very difficult position. Boon instead of 2-3 days, established in the late XVIII century. reforms of Maria Theresa and Joseph II, reached 6 days a week. In addition there were a tribute to nature, obligations to the landowner (summer helper days, night watchman, toloka etc.) and state (roads, bridges, a 14-year military service, land tax).</p>
<p>Industry of Western Ukraine was in a long-term stagnation. Traditional industries of local industry - leather, salt, textiles, timber, tobacco, of iron - hardly evolved. Industry remained craft the manufacturing level. In the villages was most factories that were owned by landlords or the state. Worked on them serfs.</p>
<p>In 30-40-ies. The nineteenth century. under the influence of the industrial revolution that swept the western provinces of the Habsburg Empire, began a revival in the industry of Eastern Galicia. In 1843 at the enterprises of the first edge of two steam engines (at that time in other parts of the empire were over 200 cars). However, the work of hired workers used very little.</p>
<p>Demand for industrial products at Western mostly satisfied its importation from the western provinces of the empire. As a result, cheap for local products factory products were causing the decline of craft manufactories of Western Ukraine.</p>
<p>Thus, agriculture Dnieper Ukraine dominant position occupied by the feudal relationship that became increasingly inhibitory factor in its development.</p>
<p>In the 30's. The nineteenth century. in Dnieper Ukraine started the Industrial Revolution. However, the pace of development slowed down the lack of civilian labor market.</p>
<p>The economy of Western Ukraine developed very slowly. The economy of the land led to agriculture, which was based on feudal relations. Serfdom was also a major obstacle to the transformation of the local manufacturing industry in the factory.</p>
