<p>Employment and unemployment</p>
<p>A very important indicator of the socio-economic condition of any country is the level of employment and unemployment. If additional information is necessary for building a strategy of economic development and the prevention of negative social consequences, the improvement of the national economy in general and the standard of living of citizens.</p>
<p>Given the state of the economy of the state can be stated that the highest employment rates observed in the industrial regions of Ukraine and Kyiv and Sevastopol. This is quite natural, because it is concentrated the vast number of industrial enterprises, transport infrastructure and functioning institutions and organizations whose activities are provided by Human Resources. In addition, as large cities are traditionally the most investment attractive: it is often implemented new investment projects which create jobs.</p>
<p>The highest unemployment rate is attributable mainly to the western region of the state, the economy of which a high proportion of agriculture. This can be explained by the fact that agriculture does not require such a large number of employees, as for example the industry. In addition, agriculture is a little later than industry went from a state of stagnation and slowly increasing volume of commodity production. That is why up to 3 million of our fellow citizens (mostly residents of Western Ukraine) left to work abroad (Portugal, Spain, Russia, etc.).</p>
<p>Given that the last 6-7 years, Ukraine has seen a steady growth in the economy, the situation is somewhat improved, employment gradually increases and the unemployment rate significantly decreased (see. The corresponding diagrams).</p>
<p>Interesting to characterize the workforce and the economy in general, the structure of employment (see. The chart to map "Economy"). If at the beginning of 90 years in the sphere of material production employed 75% of all employees, today this figure - within 70%. Much of the working population re-oriented to the service sector, which is a typical trend for developed countries.</p>
<p>As seen from the maps, employment and unemployment rates vary greatly by region of Ukraine. The lowest unemployment rates in the Kyiv and Sevastopol. In addition, in recent years the capital of the state is characteristic phenomenon personnel shortage, the labor market needs for professionals (especially working-class professions) is much higher than the number of unemployed job seekers. In some regions the situation is the opposite: unemployed for a long time could not find at least some work and therefore have to replenish the ranks of migrant workers.</p>
