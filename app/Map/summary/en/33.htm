<p>The world economy as a system of interconnected national economies are formed on the basis of international geographical division of labor (MGRT) - specialization of individual countries in the production of certain types of products, services and sharing. Interstate relations in the economic sphere are called international economic relations. Their main forms - is foreign trade, credit and financial relations, scientific and technical relations, international tourism. The map contains information on foreign trade and the credit and financial relations.</p>
<p>Formation and development of international economic relations began with foreign trade. Its volumes are constantly growing, changing trade patterns, especially rapidly growing the share of new technologies, products and services. In the world was formed three centers of international trade: Europe, Asia Pacific and North America. Trade turnover of Western Europe is about 40% of the world. In terms of absolute volume of exports to the world the first place is Germany. The second region is Asia on turnover (approximately 26%). In it the main centers of international trade are the Japan, China, the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) and the oil-producing Gulf states. In third place in terms of foreign trade of North America (about 20% of world trade). According to the volume of US imports are not competitors. Of great importance is the trade between developed and developing countries. Status raw material appendages of the industrialized countries still apply to the majority of developing countries. They still are the main suppliers of oil, copper, cotton, natural rubber, and food products: coffee, cocoa, sugar, bananas, etc. But in the export structure of NIS Asia and Latin America in recent years has increased significantly the share of manufactured goods.</p>
<p>An important indicator of foreign trade is the trade balance (surplus) - the difference between the value of exports and imports for the year. Balance can be passive (negative) and active (positive). Traditionally, the highest surplus (export value prevails over the value of imports) are Japan, Germany. The negative balance in the US is the result of large imports of raw materials and fuel from developing countries.</p>
<p>International trade is developing in the objective economic laws and is coordinated by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This organization unites 145 countries. Its main task is to create a strong and prosperous trading system of the world, facilitate increased international trade.</p>
<p>Credit and financial relations are manifested in the export (export) of capital in two forms: loans and advances, and direct investment in the creation of enterprises in foreign territory, or the acquisition of existing companies for profit or to satisfy political interests. Exports of capital - one of the most important features of foreign economic activity in developed countries. The main form of capital exports are direct investments, ie, giving the investor the right of control over the activities of a particular object. The main part of these investments provide a large multinational companies (MNCs) of the world: Nestle (Switzerland), General Motors (USA), Royal-Dutch-Shell (United Kingdom - The Netherlands), Hitachi (Japan), Daimler-Chrysler (Germany - USA) and other . Developed countries are exporting capital intensive in developing countries, there perebaziruya environmentally harmful production using low-wage labor, exploiting the natural resources of these countries. Along with investment in agriculture in developing countries, developed countries to invest more in the economy of their developed counterparts, which are less risky, but also less profitable. So part of the Japanese capital is directed to the US economy and the countries of Western Europe. EU countries are investing their capital, both within the Union and in the transition region. Investment targets are shown on the map.</p>
<p>Also on the card are the main banking and financial centers of the world, which are components of national and international banks (international banking consortium), stock and commodity exchanges. In the world there are two types of global financial centers: one arose on the basis of national capital markets (London, Paris, Zurich), the other - on the basis of international capital markets (Singapore, Hong Kong).</p>
<p>Important components of the world economy is an offshore zone - the territory or individual countries in which the preferential tax treatment, credit and currency regulation creates a simplified conditions for registration of enterprises in order to ensure the most favorable conditions for foreign capital. Now more than 100 countries and territories have offshore centers. But in industrialized countries, this practice is not common.</p>
