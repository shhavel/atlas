<p><b>The Thirty Years War</b></p>
<p>At the beginning of the XVII century. the first European war broke out. It was attended by the majority of European countries. The war lasted thirty years - from 1618 until 1648</p>
<p>The conflict, which combined political and religious controversy, brewing for a long time. The second half of XVI - early XVII century. in Germany were marked by the Counter-Reformation. Catholics began to besiege the Protestants. Both are receiving assistance from the outside: Catholics supported the Habsburgs - German Emperor and Spain, Rzeczpospolita and the Pope; Protestants - England, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Catholic France, were at war with Spain. Actually formed two coalitions. Now any excuse could lead to war.</p>
<p>And so it was an uprising in 1618 in Prague against the imperial power. The rebels have thrown out of the windows of the Habsburg officials ("Prague Remonstrance"). In response, the Catholic army led by a talented commander Tilly moved to the rebels and defeated them at the Battle of White Mountain (near Prague). In the Czech Republic began a persecution of Protestants. A Tilly moved against the Protestant princes possessions, capturing Palatinate.</p>
<p>At the same time the Spaniards thronged Dutch, capturing the important fortress of Breda.</p>
<p>Advances Catholics vstrivozhily Protestant rulers of Northern Europe. In the war against the Habsburgs</p>
<p>in 1625, she entered Denmark.</p>
<p>Scaling war caused financial problems, especially in the Habsburg coalition. The output of these difficulties suggested by Albrecht von Wallenstein. In him were combined unprincipled adventurer and talented commander. His ambition and cynicism had no boundaries. He invited the emperor to maintain an army at the expense of requisitions (robbery) of the local population. His expression "war must feed the war" became airborne. All the spoils of war, in agreement with the emperor, remained Wallenstein. For short term were recruited hundred thousandth army defeated the Danes.</p>
<p>New Advances Catholics alarmed their greatest enemy in Europe - the first French minister Cardinal Richelieu. He was able to initiate the fight against the Habsburgs of the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf in, which was an outstanding commander. Disciplined, with high morale Swedish army marched triumphant march across Germany, defeating the forces of Catholics. In the battle of LÃ¼tzen Swedes forced to retreat even Wallenstein, but the Gustav Adolf died AI. Protestants have lost the best of their commander.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Wallenstein staggered position. The Emperor refused to satisfy his ambition - to become the king of Bohemia. Against him intrigued. Wallenstein himself was playing a double game, in collusion with the Protestants, offering their services. Finally Wallenstein was accused of treason, all remaining supporters and killed.</p>
<p>When all the parties to the conflict have been weakened, in 1635 France entered the war, has long tried to capture some of the German lands.</p>
<p>Protestants gradually began to take over. All participants of the war were exhausted, Germany extremely devastated. Further continuation of the war threatened to internal problems of its members. Finally begin peace negotiations. Peace of Westphalia, concluded in 1648 was a reflection of the new balance of power in Europe. Spain and Austria lost its former superiority, while France and Sweden have increased. Sweden received tenure in the north of Germany and began to dominate the Baltic. France Alsace took away the Empire, strengthening its position on the Rhine.</p>
<p>The war between France and Spain continued for another 11 years and over by new territorial acquisitions in France.</p>
<p>Holland and Switzerland gained independence.</p>
<p>For Germany, the war turned countless victims and destruction. However strengthened Brandenburg and Bavaria.</p>
<p>The main outcome of the war was the fact that none of the states has been unable to achieve complete domination of the continent, and the struggle between them in the future become possible only when the relative dominance. Also, religious affiliation has lost its relevance to the fore the public interest. In Europe, the Spanish domination of the French changed.</p>
