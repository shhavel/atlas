<p>The main fuel resources in the world are oil, natural gas, coal and lignite. The total area of ​​coal basins and deposits reaches 15% of the land. They mainly concentrated in the northern hemisphere (the names of 10 of the largest pools of coal and lignite signed on the map).</p>
<p>Oil and gas are produced in 80 countries worldwide. But it is in the countries of the Middle East is concentrated more than half of the world's proven oil reserves and a third of the world's gas reserves. Significant oil reserves are explored also in South America, Southeast Asia, North Africa. Among the largest gas reserves in Russia has oil - Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Fuel resources, as well as other mineral resources are exhaustible and non-renewable. At the current rate of use of their stocks run out quickly, so there is a need to find and use other unconventional energy resources. Now the world has used wind energy, tidal energy, solar and geothermal energy.

 The map contains information about the Earth's geothermal resources are explored in the 50 countries of the world you are. The most significant are in areas with high seismic and volcanic activity in the so-called geothermal zones. Geothermal containing dry steam used for the construction of geothermal power plants. The first geothermal power plants were built in Italy. Now they are in the US, Mexico, Japan, Russia, Canada, Switzerland, New Zealand. In the US state of California operates world's largest geothermal power plants Geysers. Much wider use heat for heating the Earth's interior. Thus, the capital of Iceland, Reykjavik, from 1930 uses geothermal energy for heating.</p>
