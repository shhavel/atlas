All other academic institutions, including the Ukrainian Scientific Society, have been eliminated or subordinated to it.</p>
<p>In 20-30 years went active process of nationalization of science, its indoctrination. Public party leadership was to determine the nature of the ideological, personnel and organizational changes in science. The main criterion for evaluating the scientist was party loyalty and power, not his scientific abilities.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks, having gained power in Ukraine and other national republics mostly violent means had to win the affection of the population to keep it. To this end, they began a broad campaign aimed at rooting its impact on the ground, creating loyal Bolshevik Party of human resources with the local population.

<p>Revolutionary enthusiasm and Politics of Ukrainian preconditions for rapid artistic life of 20 years. There was a galaxy of young and talented Ukrainian artists, whose creative work resulted in a true renaissance of Ukrainian culture. There were numerous centers of literary creation. Created unions, clubs, studios. In particular, the group led by neoclassical M.Zerovym, union "Plough" association "Garth", "VAPLITE" (VAPLITE) and others.</p>

All creative work of writers, artists had to meet the requirements of a single creative method of socialist realism. Its main features considered to be: the presence of a new hero revolutionary proletarian communist; glorification of communist ideals; mapping and assessment of life situations from the point of view of Marxism-Leninism; diversity of art forms and manifestations. Anyone who did not fit into this system did not have the right to work.</p>
<p>Therefore Ukrainian masters of literature and art, in his work had a distinct national character, became the object of Stalinist repression. They were accused of "bourgeois nationalism" and destroyed. So he denounced and Ukrainian scientists who conduct research ukrainovedcheskie, professors, teachers and others.
