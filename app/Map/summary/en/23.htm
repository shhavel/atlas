<p>Utilities - industry, including the production of different kinds of electric power and transportation of its power lines to the consumer. Electricity development depends primarily on the level of economic development, the availability of energy resources, their quality, location, method of production. Total amounts of electricity production and consumption per capita is one of the key indicators of economic development of any country. So 3/4 of world energy production accounts for 10 countries: USA, Japan, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, France, the UK, Ukraine and India.</p>
<p>Most of the world's electricity is produced in thermal power plants (TPP) that use traditional fuels: coal, gas, fuel oil. Up to 20% of the world electricity comes from hydropower plants (HPP). In countries with well-to-hydropower, this figure is much higher: Norway (99%), Brazil (92%), Austria, Canada, Peru, New Zealand - over 50%.</p>
<p>Nuclear power plants (NPP) provides up to 10% of global electricity production. They use the energy of the decay of radioactive isotopes of uranium or plutonium. NPP Nuclear reactors operate in 32 countries. Leading positions on electricity produced by nuclear power plants occupy in France (76%), Belgium (61%), Germany, Ukraine (45%).</p>
<p>Only 1% of the world's electricity generated by power plants that use non-traditional (alternative) energy sources: solar, wind, tidal, wave energy, bioenergy, geothermal energy. Most of them are geothermal power plants that use the internal heat of the Earth (bar chart and comment submitted on the map "Fuel Resources").</p>
