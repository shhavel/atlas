<p><b>KONTRREFORMATSIYNYY MOVEMENT IN UKRAINE</b></p>
<p><b>Historical Background</b></p>
<p>The beginnings of the Counter-Reformation - Catholic reform of church life - the researchers associated with the deployment of the Reform movement and conduct of the Catholic Council of Trent (1545-1563). The idea of ​​reforming the Catholic Church were different. Some predicted for reforms of the Catholic Church because of its approach to the Reformation churches. Another idea was based on the entire rejection of creeds, the Reformation born, unto their ad war. Won second position. However, the methods of dealing with the Reformation were largely Reformation: the introduction of its own school system, developing its own printing press, giving special importance to sermons and more. Reforming the Catholic Church served the Jesuits (literally "Society of Jesus"), founded in 1534 and formally approved by the Pope in 1540 Jesuits rallied around the idea of ​​renewal of the Catholic Church the great intellectual force. In this case, the main means of persuasion were teaching activities and diplomacy. In various European countries, the Jesuits established schools, which did not yield a Protestant. With 60 years of the XVI century. Jesuits launched operations in Poland. And by the beginning of the XVII century. in the Commonwealth, there were 15 Jesuit colleges.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Jesuits in Ukraine promoted Union of Lublin. In 1571 Jesuit College was opened in Yaroslav (Galicia, and soon appeared Jesuit school in Lviv, Kamenetz, Lutsk, Przemysl, jail, Novgorod-Seversky and Kiev.</p>
<p>1593 began to operate Zamoyski Academy - an educational institution of higher type.</p>
<p>Implement the powerful educational program, the Jesuits sought to increase the number of supporters of Catholicism. The level of education that he gave Jesuit schools, attracted Ukrainian nobles; besides their graduates had the opportunity to deepen their education in European universities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Jesuits promoted education Ukrainian pryluchaly the achievements of European science. However, at that time Ukrainian deprived of their own state, had no choice in the field of education. Paid the same for education in Jesuit schools often become the abdication of parental faith and therefore nationality - because after the Union of Brest Jesuit activity was directed against the Orthodox Church.</p>
<p><b>The Orthodox church</b></p>
<p>The main reason for the decline of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine was the loss of their own country. To counteract Polish Catholicism, which, through an extensive network of Catholic colleges and relentless printing spread impact on the new eastern lands, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church had to develop its own education system. But neither sufficient number of books, or the training institutes for senior clergy were not.</p>
<p>The situation was complicated by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and external circumstances. Fascinated by the Turks in 1453, Constantinople had lost the status of orthodoxy, and therefore could not provide the necessary support for the Orthodox Church in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Instead, every year more and more powerful became Moscow Metropolis who wanted to take glory extinct Constantinople. Proclamation 1589 independence of the Moscow Patriarchate and the provision of his chapter title of Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia is extremely alarmed Ukrainian as eloquent evidence of the intentions of Muscovy to Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p><b>Opinions regarding the Orthodox Union with Catholics</b></p>
<p>Realizing the complexity of the situation, which was the Mother Church, representatives of the higher clergy and nobility and Ukrainian tycoons are increasingly inclined to the idea of ​​union with the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p><b>Church council in Brest in 1596</b></p>
<p>To speed up the implementation of the idea of ​​union in life, two of Orthodox bishops - the largest of its proponents Potiy Hypatia and Cyril Terletskyi - went on a trip to Rome in late 1595 held their meeting with the Pope of Ceremony and connection bishops of the Catholic Church .</p>
<p>However, despite the agreement, the final decision on the union, according to tradition, had to endure council.</p>
<p>He was appointed on October 6, 1596 in the city. Brest (now Brest in Belarus).</p>
<p>To the Council of Brest prepared not only supporters of the union, but also its opponents.</p>
<p><b>Supporters of the union:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Polish government;</li>
<li>Metropolitan Michael Rogoza and bishops.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Opponents of the union:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Prince Vasili, Constantine Ostrog, who led the fight antyuniynu;</li>
<li>Bishops Lvov Gideon Balaban and Michael Peremyshl Kopystyansky;</li>
<li>brotherhoods and monasteries;</li>
<li>most of the gentry and burghers;</li>
<li>the peasantry.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Failed to agree even on a joint meeting, each party October 8, 1596 started a separate church.</b></p>
<p>Supporters of the union acted in an urban cathedral St. Nicholas. approved a preliminary decision on the formation of the Greek Catholic Church. King Sigismund III supported the union and declared valid decision Uniate church. Opponents of the union gathered in the palace, where he stayed Ostrog. Condemned the union and lords-apostates.</p>
<p>The new church was subordinate to the Pope.</p>
<p>It was recognized some of the principles of the Catholic Faith (dogmas), in particular dogma of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son (Orthodox recognize that the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the Father).</p>
<p>Religious ceremonies, feasts, sacraments, especially the temple construction, iconography, church music remained Orthodox, and the language of worship - Church Slavonic.</p>
<p>Greek Catholic clergy as Catholic, exempt from paying taxes.</p>
<p>Uniate along with the Catholic gentry could qualify for public office.</p>
<p>Greek Catholic bishops have been promised a place in the Senate.</p>
<p>As for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, it is, despite the large number of supporters was illegal.</p>
<p>Ukrainians were divided and even churches. So an event designed to unite strengthened opposition, because opponents of the union pledged to fight by all means against it.</p>
