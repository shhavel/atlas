Yaroslav the Wise was lucky, say researchers, is much more than all his predecessors and even many successors. He lived a long life and died at the height of her fame and power. To this day preserved marble sarcophagus with the remains of his examining which scientists have not only restored the exterior of the prince, but found to have suffered from a disease.

On the walls of St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev - Temple, built by Yaroslav the Wise, the oldest fragments of images, among which are some of the most Yaroslav and his family. After many campaigns and battles, winning in the confrontation with his brothers the right to rule in Kiev, Yaroslav escaped accusations of cruelty and perfidy, and remained in the memory of posterity peaceful, quiet and prudent prince, who showed enthusiasm for books, often reading them during the day and night, for which he was honored by the name Wise.</p>
<p><b>1. The power struggle between the sons of Vladimir Svyatoslavich</b></p>
<p><b>Claims Yaroslav Vladimirovich the Grand table</b></p>
<p>From the Chronicle we learn that the first Yaroslav was in possession of his father Rostov.</p>
<p>Soon after Vladimir gave him a prestigious portion - Novgorod. It happened, the Chronicle, after the death of the Novgorod prince Volodymyr older son Vysheslav.</p>
<p>Reign in Novgorod was overshadowed complication relationship with his father. Chronicler said that the reluctance of Kyiv Yaroslav pay annual tribute between father and son nearly went to war. Actually, Vladimir lashtuvav wife to campaign against Novgorod, but suddenly rozhvorivsya died.</p>
<p><b>Death of Vladimir the Great destroyed the established order in the country, four years, the fever, inflamed mizhknyazivski strife for power in Kiev, during which four of the left head Volodymyr's sons, and was destined to become the winner of Yaroslav.</b></p>
<p><b>Fight for Kyiv</b></p>
<p>The entire blame for the bloody strife between the Rus Vladimirovich written monuments impose on Svjatopolka - the eldest of the living children at the time of Vladimir. It Sviatopolk after the death of his father in 1015 established in Kyiv.</p>
<p>The first victims were the youngest insidious plan V. - Boris and Gleb. Later they shared the fate of more and Sviatoslav.</p>
<p>Innocent blood shed pokvapyla Yaroslav to action. Upon receipt of Novgorod the news of his father's death and lawlessness Svjatopolka, he was ordered to march lashtuvatysya retainers.</p>
<p>The first armed confrontation with Yaroslav Sviatopolk occurred, presumably researchers, early winter 1015 when Liubech. The fierce battle ended in complete defeat troops Svjatopolka.</p>
<p>Defeated Duke retreated from the battlefield, so Jaroslav freely entered Kyiv.</p>
<p>After the defeat of 1015 Sviatopolk fled to Poland, under the shelter of King Boleslaw the Brave, who accounted him father. Sviatopolk Boleslaw persuaded to lead the army in the Ruthenian lands. The campaign took place in 1018</p>
<p>This time the battle between Yaroslav and Sviatopolk held the Bug near Volyn.</p>
<p>Won Boleslaw the Brave Warriors, Jaroslav left Kyiv and returned to Novgorod.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, August 4, 1018 in the capital of Russia became the host of Boleslaw and Svjatopolka.</p>
<p>Chronicle reported that they were treated extremely rudely, feeling conquerors.</p>
<p>It's not like the people of Kiev. Residents of the city revolted.</p>
<p>Boleslav, taking many robbed of property and many prisoners rushed to leave Kyiv.</p>
<p>Sviatopolk, losing the last commitment of Kiev, in the face of a new campaign Yaroslav fled from the city to the Pechenegs.</p>
<p>Jaroslav properly used the bitter experience of defeat and gathered for a decisive battle with Svyatoslav "numerous howl."</p>
<p>In 1019 the River Alta Jaroslav Svjatopolka broken army, forcing Cain shamefully run away - somewhere in exile forever lost his trail.</p>
<p><b>Lost brothers Boris and Gleb were soon joined the saints: they are destined to become the first saints canonized Ruthenian Church. And so poshanovuyemo of us. Sviatopolk was condemned by the fratricide Cain as the Old Testament - the story is still remembered him as a Svjatopolka Accursed. And Yaroslav the Wise earned fame just ruler who put an end to strife and the first to honor the victims of fratricidal war, vidnayshovshy their remains and buried with military honors in Vyshegorod.</b></p>
<p><b>2. Establishment of Yaroslav Vladimirovich of Kiev</b></p>
<p>In the year 1019 the chronicler noted: "He sat Yaroslav in Kiev, wiped the sweat from his wife, showing the victory and great work."</p>
<p>Soon after the establishment of Kiev Yaroslav was forced to leave the capital and go to the northern lands to end the assault on Novgorod prince of Polotsk, Yaroslav nephew, Brjachislav.</p>
<p>Once a conflict has been resolved, as in force new - with Tmutarakansky prince Mstislav, who in 1023 accidentally took his wife to Kyiv. Mstislav accounted Jaroslav younger brother.</p>
<p>Previous intestine wars, he, according to the chronicler, did not participate. As for his claim to Kyiv, they got an unexpected development.</p>
<p>The fact that Mstislav won the battle of Yaroslav, but refused to Kyiv, paying tribute to his older brother.</p>
<p>Year 1026 to agree to a peace deal under which Russian lands were divided along the Dnieper River, right bank of Kyiv land owned by Jaroslav, and the left bank of Chernihiv - Mstislav. This procedure reign lasted 10 years - to the death of Mstislav.</p>
<p><b>So only from 1036 Jaroslav edinovlastnym became ruler of Kievan Rus.</b></p>
<p><b>3. Domestic Policy</b></p>
<p><b>Territorial integrity and unity of the Rus</b></p>
<p>Jaroslav</p>
<ul>
<li>back under his power Chervensk city reclaimed during princely strife Boleslaw the Brave;</li>
<li>also went to the north, on the Baltic coast, where stretches of land laid the city of St. George.</li>
<li>not abandon construction commenced his father, on the northern border of Russia.</li>
<li>finally defeated the Pechenegs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The news of the final, winning for Yaroslav battle against the Pechenegs, which took place under the walls Kyiv placed under 1036, however, modern historians attribute it to 1017 to commemorate the victory Jaroslav ordered to lay on the town battle magnificent church - St. Sophia Cathedral.</p>
<p><b>Development of Kyiv</b></p>
<p>About the time of Kyiv Yaroslav the Wise said that he was an ornament of Russia and rival of Constantinople.</p>
<p>Area "of the city of Yaroslav" compared to the stronghold by Vladimir increased sevenfold. Another higher and stronger walls and steel shaft.</p>
<p>Highlight of Kyiv were Golden Gate - the main entrance to the city - Gate Church of the Annunciation, St. Sophia Cathedral, the church of St. George, built in honor of the patron saint of Kievan prince [church name Yaroslav - George (Yuri)] and the Church of St. Irene.</p>
<p>The real gem of ancient architecture, the greatest building in Kyiv time of Yaroslav the Wise was the Hagia Sophia.</p>
<p>It was great, topped the 13 stone church domes, surrounded on three sides by two rows of open galleries.</p>
<p>From the west to the cathedral was added two towers with wide spiral staircase to the church choirs.</p>
<p>Even better than the external grandeur, pryholomshuvalo interior of the church. Most impressed wall image - frescoes and mosaics, among which many were dedicated to the founder of the church - Prince Yaroslav the Wise.</p>
<p>Kiev Sofia symbolizes the combination of the divine and of the government. The cathedral was once a major, metropolitan church of and place of the most solemn state ceremonies - Climbing the Grand table, acceptance of foreign ambassadors and others.</p>
<p><b>Streamlining legislation</b></p>
<p>Setting up the inner life was impossible without ordering laws.</p>
<p>The activities in this area at one time resorted Prince Vladimir.</p>
<p>And the glory of the true reformer law belongs to Jaroslav - he was the first who signed a written collection of Russian laws.</p>
<p>That document researchers call "true Yaroslav" or oldest true.</p>
<p>It consisted of 18 articles, which launched the famous collection of laws - "n the truth."</p>
<p>The articles dealt Jaroslav</p>
<ul>
<li>the punishment for murder,</li>
<li>beating up blood or bruises,</li>
<li>committed by injury,</li>
<li>pulling his beard and mustache,</li>
<li>ride on someone else's horse,</li>
<li>property damage,</li>
<li>harboring alien slave like.</li>
</ul>
<p>The penalty provided for the most part cash payments, though still retained the right to family blood feud.</p>
<p>Cash payments paid either in favor of the prince - they were called "religious believes", or in favor of the victim or his family - "holovschyny." Corporal punishment had applied only to slaves for beating a free man. Among the penalties was not the death penalty.</p>
<p><b>Support the Christian Church</b></p>
<p>Yaroslav the Wise and strongly contributed to the spread in the Ruthenian lands of Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>He not only took care of the construction of churches, but also maintained the authority of the prince's power is not yet strong church organization.</p>
<p>Thus, with the assistance of Yaroslav the Wise, the first in 1051 was elected Metropolitan of Rus - they became Hilarion.</p>
<p>In 1051, proclaimed chronicler, a monk Anthony was initiated Pechersk Monastery - in the near future leading center of ecclesiastical and cultural and educational life.</p>

<p>To meet the needs of Russian churches in the books, Yaroslav made Kiev St. Sophia Cathedral in the scriptorium workshop is to rewrite the books.</p>
<p>There's still taught literacy and oznayomlyuvaly with the basics of science with children of wealthy families.</p>
<p>The cathedral acted kind of library could consist of up to 1,000 volumes of rare books. Sofia worked in the library of ancient scribes - priests, scholars, chroniclers, ancient Rus writers and scientists.</p>
<p>There were schools and at other churches and monasteries. Evidence of the spread of literacy among the various segments of contemporary Kyiv is graffiti.</p>
<p><b>4. The foreign policies of Yaroslav the Wise</b></p>
<p>In foreign policy, diplomacy used all the possibilities, among them a prominent place occupied inter-dynasty marriages. No wonder Yaroslav the Wise called father of Europe.</p>
<p>The extent of foreign policy activity of Yaroslav and his authority as ruler evidenced by the fact that all his children, he married advantageously. Porodychavshys noblest of the European family, a wise prince of Kievan Rus connected with Europe by blood ties.</p>
<p>Traditionally, a close relationship developed between Kievan Rus and Byzantium.</p>
<p>However, the friendly alliance Byzantium and Russia have experienced trials after approval to the imperial throne of Constantine IX Monomakh in 1042</p>
<p>He started his activity with that removed from the governance of henchmen previous emperors.</p>
<p>Before the band got disgraced Russians and people. Relations between Russia and Byzantium particularly acute in 1043</p>
<p>Immediate cause of the Russo-Byzantine conflict was strife between Constantinople market Rusichi and Greeks. During her n merchants had suffered heavy losses, and one notable Russ died.</p>
<p>Yaroslav the Wise, of course, could not respond to antyruski action Constantine IX. It gathered a large army. Going to Constantinople headed son of Vladimir and Yaroslav governor Vyshata.</p>
<p>Ruski ships appeared before Constantinople in June 1043, however the war never came.</p>
<p>Byzantium agreed to concessions. A new peace treaty was sealed with the marriage of Yaroslav's son Vsevolod Monomakh daughter Mary.</p>
<p>And soon, in 1051, relations between Kyiv and Constantinople deteriorated again. The reason for dissatisfaction Constantinople authorities were putting the Kiev Metropolitan Hilarion. But even then zalahodyly conflict peacefully.</p>
<p>Maintained regular contact times of Kievan Rus Yaroslav and the German Empire. Contemporary sources include reports of Rus embassy in 1040 to Henry III.</p>
<p>For three years the ambassadors of the "Russian King" again visited Germanic ruler: they allegedly offered him, shows chronicler, the wife was daughter of the Duke.</p>
<p>But Henry had already married, so offer Rus not.</p>
<p>Still, around the middle of the XI century. several marriages between the royal family and Yaroslav Germanic powers were concluded.</p>
<p>Particularly lively relationship had Kievan Rus with Poland.</p>
<p>The expression of good-neighborly relations were marital relationships. The Polish Prince Casimir married sister Mary Dobronihoyu Yaroslav, and his sister, Gertrude, married Olisava Iziaslav Yaroslav.</p>
<p>Russia supported the close relationship with the Scandinavian countries.</p>
<p>Especially strengthened ties Russia and Sweden, helped by marriage with Yaroslav Ingigerda.</p>
