<p>Japan</p>
<p>During the First World War, Japan, speaking on the side of the Entente, occupied the German colony in the Far East and the Pacific. Japan used the most current situation to increase their military capabilities, and above all the fleet. The flip side of the militarization of the country was poverty. In August and September 1918 the country a wave of "rice riots" - spontaneous demonstrations against rising prices for basic foodstuffs. No sooner had the government to suppress these statements, as in 1919 the country embraced the strike movement of workers, and in the main colony Japan - Korea's anti-Japanese uprising broke out.</p>
<p>The post-war instability resulted in a sharp political struggle. The right-wing forces saw a way out of territorial expansion, the left - in the revolution and democratic reforms. These difficulties were added the economic crisis of 1920-1921. And an earthquake in 1923, which completely destroyed the capital Tokyo, killing 150 thousand. People. Acuteness internal political battles and added that Japan was defeated in the intervention against Soviet Russia and was forced under the pressure of the great powers to give up their positions in China, conquered in the past.</p>
<p>All 20 years were spent in acute political struggle between two tendencies. Finally won supporters expansionist foreign policy and the establishment of a totalitarian regime. All democratic gains were lost.</p>
<p>The impetus for foreign expansion has become a global economic crisis 30 years, which is extremely worsened the economic situation in Japan. In addition, the country is rapidly losing its market position in the Asia-Pacific region, not withstanding competition from the US. In such circumstances, the Japanese ruling elite ventured into open aggression against China, hiding behind the slogan of combating the spread of communism in Asia. In the 1931-1932 biennium. Japan occupied Manchuria, creating a springboard for further aggression.</p>
<p>In 1933, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. At the same time supporters of the expansionist policies (including "young officers") believed that the ruling elite are hesitant in implementing aggressive plans that were still in 1927 outlined by Prime Minister General Tanaka. In 1932 and 1936, respectively proponents more drastic aggressive action did riots against the government. Although the rebellion was suppressed, the requirements of the "young officers" have not gone unnoticed. In the summer there was a secret meeting of the ruling circles regarding the prospects of the "colonial expansion" in East Asia. Japan declared aim of creating a "Greater East Asian areas of common prosperity. "November 27, 1936 Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which was the beginning of forming the axis of aggressive states who sought division of the world.</p>
<p>In July 1937, the Japanese began an armed invasion of the North and Central China. The reason for the war was a conflict between Japanese and Chinese soldiers on the Marco Polo Bridge, located on the neutral zone. Active offensives Japanese Army continued until 1939 The Japanese managed to capture the most developed regions of China and, having received substantial raw material and manpower partially solved their economic problems.</p>
<p>The Japanese economy has been put at the service of war. The constant need for military-strategic raw materials has prompted the Japanese government to resort to a significant increase in imports due to the decrease of gold reserves and enhanced export of goods at low prices. Preparation economy to large-scale war went under the slogan of a "new economic structure". It provided the concentration of production, the active development of heavy, especially the military, industry, causing loss industry that worked on the domestic market. "New economic structure" meant the establishment of military and government control over the economy of the country. As the controlling authorities created the Association of producers in various fields of management. Led associations were representatives of major corporations, which effectively meant the transfer of the regulation of all processes in the economy. Also was completely destroyed labor and democratic movement. Officially it was called "Movement for the mobilization of the national spirit." December 15, 1937 the police conducted mass arrests of Communists, trade unionists and members of progressive intellectuals. In late December it was forbidden activities of political parties, trade unions. Instead, they were created by Imperial Rule Assistance Association and patriotic Industry Association of Japan large.</p>
<p>Thus, in Japan been established economic and political model is characterized by totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>Synhayska Revolution 1911-1912 biennium. Has not solved all the problems standing in the way of China. Its only positive achievement was the overthrow of the monarchy. The country needed to continue to upgrade and elimination semi-colonial dependence on major powers.</p>
<p>Continued after the First World War the great powers of the imperialist policy toward China was the reason for the deployment of a broad anti-colonial movement. The fight began, students in Beijing. May 4, 1919, they came to demonstrations and rallies. To students later joined the workers and artisans Shanghai. The movement was supported by Chinese businessmen and industrialists. It lasted more than two months and ended with the government went to some concessions, removed from office proyaponskyh officials released the arrested students, the Chinese delegation signed the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>The movement, called the "May 4th Movement", contributed to the growth of national consciousness, the formation of political parties and left-wing organizations that advocated the unification of the country, liberation from foreign domination and social reform. He waves spread and has been successful struggle for the "new culture", including an introduction to literature, language, close to home. This made it possible to get an education to many millions of Chinese. The movement led to the radicalization of national liberation sentiment.</p>
<p>In 1921 was founded the Communist Party of China (CPC), which saw the revolution is the only way to resuscitate the country. Its founder was a professor at Beijing Li Dachzhao.</p>
<p>Significant event towards the restoration of national unity and sovereignty of China were revolutionary events of 1925-1927 years., Largely provoked by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On the eve of the events in China were three influential forces that fought for power: government official in Beijing Ґomindan led by Sun Yat-sen and PDAs. In addition, they had to fight militant groups in the provinces, as well as colonizers.</p>
<p>In 1921 the Red Army of Soviet Russia, opposing Japanese aggression in the Far East, captured territory Outer Mongolia. It was declared Mongolian People's Republic. Broke conflict with the Chinese government, which also claimed the area.</p>
<p>In 1922 China has left the Soviet diplomatic mission. She had to agree upon their relationship with the government official in Beijing, and at the same time support Ґomindan in the struggle for power. The Soviet leadership believed it Ґomindan Meanwhile the power, upon which could realize the idea of ​​world revolution in Asia.</p>
<p>After the failure of talks in Beijing, the Soviet mission went to Canton, where he signed an agreement with Sun Yat-sen. The agreement provided for the establishment of an independent, but based on the Soviet Union ґomindanivskoho China. Soviet Russia was obliged to provide financial and military support Ґomindanovi in ​​the struggle for power. To this end, China was sent a group of soldiers led by a representative of the Comintern and V.Blyuherom M.Borodina, who for several years played a key role in relations between the CPC and Ґomindanom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Soviet Union, playing a double game, has signed an agreement with the Beijing government of understanding and of maintaining control of the Soviet Union over the Chinese Eastern Railway and Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>On the recommendation of the Comintern in 1923 in Guangzhou (Canton) government was formed with representatives Ґomindanu and PDAs. Was jointly established by the army. Government headed by Sun Yat-sen. But before the events of 1925 he died.</p>
<p>The impetus to the revolutionary events was shot by British police textile peaceful demonstration in Shanghai, which was held under the theme of exile from the country colonizers. May 30, 1925 protest in Shanghai uprising broke out, supported by all sections of society ("May 30 Movement").</p>
<p>It was a spontaneous patriotic enthusiasm, which launched a national revolution.</p>
<p>The goal of the revolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>restore the sovereignty of China;</li>
<li>elimination of militaristic groups;</li>
<li>reunification;</li>
<li>the socio-economic transformation and modernization of China.</li>
</ul>
<p>The peculiarity of the national revolution in China was that it intertwined fighting imperialist powers of the various segments of the population for their rights, a struggle for power and the peasant war.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Government declared itself to national and began fighting for the unification of China. Chief of the Army Ґomindanu was Chiang Kai-shek. In October-December 1925 troops under his command captured the province of Guangdong, and in July 1926 began the trek North, a plan developed by a Soviet adviser Blucher.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1926 troops Chiang Kai-shek took Wuhan, in February 1927 - Nanjing, in March of that year - Shanghai. After the capture of Nanjing Chiang Kai-shek moved the capital there and created a national government, which has received support from some militaristic communities of the North. He and his supporters believed that the goal was achieved and should undertake to reform efforts. However, the CPC insisted that the revolution should continue and take the path of socialist construction. In the revolutionary camp split.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek, who had authority, but tyazhyvsya alliance with the CCP and the Soviet tutelage, failed to act decisively. In April 1927 anti-communist revolution carried out by setting your personal power.</p>
<p>This Chiang Kai-shek was able to unite China under his rule. Trying Communist uprising in Nanchang failed. After that diplomatic relations between the USSR and China ordnance. CCP embarked on a guerrilla warfare against Ґomindanu.</p>
<p>During the struggle between Ґomindanom and PDA formed main ideas of the Chinese Communist revolution in China is mainly peasant and will take the form of guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>In the 1930-1934 biennium. Army Chiang Kai-shek made five victorious campaigns against Soviet regions formed by the Communists. The movement for the establishment of Soviet power in China was defeated, but was not destroyed.</p>
<p>In 1931 the CPC led by Mao Zedong. He, being the son of a peasant, said farmers are simple, clear way: it is necessary to distribute the land, all those who support him will be rewarded criminals and traitors - punished. Under his leadership in the 1934-1935 biennium. 100,000th guerrilla army, completing a "Long March" (passed with 12 thousand battles. Km), was transferred to the North of China - closer to the Soviet Union and the Japanese front line. Here at the junction of three provinces - Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia was formed special border area, which became the base recovery and subsequent deployment of the communist movement.</p>
<p>Japanese aggression and Soviet pressure forced the CCP and Ґomindan in April 1937 once again join forces. During the negotiations, PDAs and Ґomindan reached agreement on cessation of hostilities against each other. CCP undertook to transform the council authorities to democratic government and the Red Army - the military units of the People's Revolutionary Army, to stop the confiscation of land from landowners and transfer to farmers.</p>
<p>The main burden of the struggle against Japanese aggression took over three million army of Chiang Kai-shek. USSR and the USA gave him credit, military equipment, advisers.</p>
<p>The actions of the Chinese army had not been a success. By the fall of 1939 all of East China invaded Japan. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek at every reasonable opportunity was trying to hit their "allies" - the Communists, which he ubachav main rivals in the struggle for power. Failures Ґomindanu automatically lifted authority Communists who rather consistently and successfully fought against the Japanese in their controlled areas of northern China. Moreover, these districts were a testing ground for reforms aimed at improving the lives of the peasants, who were the main social base of the CCP. At the same time the territory controlled Ґomindanom, farmers suffered all kinds of oppression.</p>
<p>At the end of the war PDAs become popular Peasant Party, which had a significant military force (8 Army NRA and 4 new army NRA). This has allowed her to enter a decisive phase of the struggle for power that ended with her victory in the early 50's.</p>
<p>India</p>
<p>The First World War led to new intensification of the contradictions between the Indian people and the British colonialists. During the war, the colonial authorities had promised to provide the Indian government. However, hopes of Indians were not justified.</p>
<p>All dissatisfied with the existing audio system went into opposition to the English government. The leading role in the national liberation struggle of the occupied Indian National Congress (INC), a recognized leader which was M. Gandhi.</p>
<p>Ґandyzm that combines political, ethical and philosophical concepts, rooted in Indian culture, found an echo in the general public of the Indian peasantry and the urban poor. The merit of Gandhi was that the idea of ​​the struggle for independence and the transformation of society he presented in accessible and affordable to the majority of images. The people called him Mahatma, meaning "great soul." Broad support for the methods used by Gandhi fight that did not include violence. It was important that Gandhi protested combined with tolerance for colonizers.</p>
<p>In terms of India with its multi-ethnic population, a colorful religious and social composition of non-violent action was the only acceptable means to attract people to a common struggle.</p>
<p>Another powerful force in the anti-colonial struggle was the Muslim League, which unlike the Congress resorted to military action.</p>
<p>English colonial administration in its fight against the liberation movement found support among a section of Indian society - Raja (princes) and large landowners actively inflamed religious and caste disputes.</p>
<p>The immediate impetus for the rise of the national liberation movement in 1918-1922. Were reforms that perpetuate colonial situation in India. Post-war rise of the national liberation struggle began with mass strikes in large industrial centers of Bombay, Madras, Kanpur, Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>British colonial administration to somehow pohamuvaty spontaneous movement, succeeded in reforming governance. In 1919 the British Parliament passed a law on the Government of India. He reaffirmed India's colonial status. The reform included the expansion of Indian representation in the council of the Viceroy of India and the provincial governors, as well as increasing the number of voters from 1 to 3%. However, a law was passed Rouletta, which defined punishment for anti-government actions.</p>
<p>The actions of the colonial administration, especially Rouletta law, gave a powerful impetus to the deployment of mass civil disobedience movement.</p>
<p>April 6, 1919 Gandhi called for a curtailment of any business and the closure of shops in protest against the law Rouletta.</p>
<p>The answer was the colonial violence. April 13, 1919 in Amritsar, Punjab province, the British shot the peaceful demonstration. Killed more than 1 thousand. People 2 thousand. Were injured. This action violence could provoke a spontaneous revolt, but Gandhi through his lucky escape.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1919 congress Congress decided to boycott the elections. The boycott has reached its goal.</p>
<p>Events 1919 Gandhi led to the idea of ​​a clear plan for further combat. The first phase provided for a boycott campaign of colonial institutions and products. The second - tax evasion. This is meant to open conflict with the colonial administration.</p>
<p>The campaign of nonviolent resistance began August 1, 1920, but in early 1922 there were events that made her collapse. In one village a crowd of peasants burnt alive several policemen. In Muslim areas of the rebellion broke out. The colonialists was thrown against the rebel forces. Gandhi condemned such actions and announced the termination of the action.</p>
<p>Stabilization period (1922-1929 gg.) India has experienced no major shocks, although once in a while one of the leaders of the Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru called for full independence.</p>
<p>The global economic crisis had a negative impact on the economy of India. Collapsed prices for its main exports. The ruin and impoverishment of a large part of farmers and businessmen led to the deployment of a new wave of national liberation movements. A new period of anti-colonial struggle was marked by greater organization and clarity of purpose - Independence and Constitution.</p>
<p>The impetus for the fight was the arrival of the British Commission for politicians who have to work out a new constitution for India. Indian public was outraged by the fact that the development of the constitution was removed most famous Indian leaders. All Indian organizations boycotted the work of the British Commission.</p>
<p>By decision of the Congress began a new campaign of civil disobedience. January 26, 1930 declared the Independence Day of India. Signal to the second phase was to be demonstrative violation of existing monopolies in India colonial authorities on production and sale of salt.</p>
<p>In March 1930 Gandhi, accompanied by his followers went on a three-week trip to the coast of the Arabian Sea, to evaporate salt from sea water. This campaign had a huge impact on Indian society. Some cities have begun spontaneous uprising. Riots spread to and the army. The colonial authorities announced INC illegal. 60 thousand. Participants campaign was thrown into prison. But the movement did not stop and became even more widespread. Across the country, people protested against the arrest of their leader. Members mass demonstrations devoted precepts of Gandhi, did not use force, even when they were severely beaten.</p>
<p>A further increase tensions in the country forced the colonizers and the Congress leaders to negotiate.</p>
<p>In 1931 between the leaders of Congress and the British administration signed an agreement under which the colonizers stop repression and freed prisoners, salt monopoly likvidovuvalas and Congress stop a campaign of civil disobedience. Viceroy of India Edward Irvine (Lord Halifax) gave an illusory promise in the future to India's independence.</p>
<p>Gandhi agreed to take part in the conference "round table", convened in London to discuss the problems of India. So the fight was moved to the table. At the conference, the Congress filed a draft constitution entitled "On the basic rights and duties of citizens of India."</p>
<p>The conference ended in failure. Then Congress in 1932 announced a new campaign of civil disobedience. In response, Congress banned the colonizers and threw Gandhi to prison.</p>
<p>But the British government realized that with India to do something, because over time the Indians themselves solve the problem of independence in their favor. In 1935 the British Parliament passed the Government of India Act, under which the Indian empire had become a federal dominion, consisting of the individual states. Suffrage received 12% of the population was expanded rights of local legislative bodies, but the colonial system was maintained.</p>
<p>In 1937 elections were held that gained credibility INC. He won a majority in 8 of 11 provinces and formed local governments. It was a great step forward in the pursuit of power and the accumulation of a democratic, parliamentary experience. Despite this success the Congress failed to unite people of all religious faiths in India. Muslim League called on his supporters to fight for a separate Muslim province - the country of Pakistan ("Land of the net").</p>
<p>With the outbreak of World War Viceroy of India announced a belligerent country. India was on the side of anti-Hitler coalition. Implementation of the provisions of the Act was postponed.</p>
<p>Powerful national liberation movement spread to other Asian countries. Thus, in 1919 won Afghanistan's independence, which was forced to acknowledge the United Kingdom. In Burma, Vietnam, Indonesia held the powerful anti-colonial rebellion, formed political forces after the Second World War brought the country on the path of independent development.</p>
