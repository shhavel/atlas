<p>They forged relations with neighboring countries, concluded peace or declared war.</p>
<p>Thus, using modern terminology, we say that the prince of Rus lands was head of state; it embodied a quiet, ordinary life of society.</p>
<p>Princely power passed from father to son, that it was hereditary.</p>
<p>Of all the princes of Kyiv prince had the greatest power; rest of the princes obeyed him as the oldest, most. Such relations are called mizhknyazivski vasalitetom, and form of government - monarchy.</p>

<p>However, no matter how influential were the knights of the council, they would prefer to have a let and obedient, but still a prince.</p>
<p><b>Congresses of princes</b></p>
<p>Grave authority had princely congresses. They gathered regularly and not all solutions of such gatherings have been realized, but the issues they discussed at the congresses were mostly of national importance.</p>

<p>The head of state and influential Duke was Grand Prince of Kyiv.</p>
<p>In the capitals of the lands, principalities sat princes. Each principality, in turn, divided into small districts, which also ruled by princes.</p>
<p>Only son of Prince could be a prince.</p>
<p><b>In addition to the princes, to nobles ruling class.</b></p>
<p>Boyarsky formed with the families of local tribal elite and influential men, who by military service received from the princes of the land estates.</p>
<p>Together with the princes, nobles were ruling the state, the Principality.</p>

<p>Peasants in written sources called simply "people" - mostly in rural communities.</p>
<p>If serf some circumstances lose their own farm, he could borrow money - "a bunch" in the feudal time, but had to work out a loan. Thus, a farmer who worked for "a bunch" in the enterprise master called «shopping».</p>
<p>After working for debt, a peasant become temporarily dependent free.</p>
<p>A variety of shopping were ryadovychi, because the circumstances of the transformation shopping smerds were fixed in the contract-series. It interprets the name "ryadovych."</p>
