<p>Latin America - is that part of the continent that lies south of the border between the United States from Mexico. The name of this region was there because of the dominance of the Spanish and Portuguese languages, which emerged from the ancient Latin language.</p>
<p>Latin American countries gained their independence in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. as a result of the armed struggle for national liberation against Spain led by such prominent figures as José San Martin, Simon Bolivar, Agustin Iturbide.</p>
<p>Former great colonial empire, Spain has maintained power only over Cuba and Puerto Rico. Victory peoples of Latin America contributed to the situation in Europe. Major European powers were engaged in the Napoleonic wars and the suppression of the revolutionary actions of 1820.</p>
<p>Also, a significant factor was the US position. In 1823, US President James Monroe declared that Americans renouncing interference in the affairs of Europe, may require non-interference in the affairs of European States. This position was expressed in the slogan "America for Americans." Subsequently, the Monroe Doctrine became an excuse for the US expansion in Latin America.</p>
<p>After independence in Latin America have developed a kind of political and economic relations, largely inherited from the colonial past.</p>
<p>Dominant position in the political and economic life took various groups of large landowners, landowners, descendants of Spanish and Portuguese nobility colonialists who used the work of landless peasants (mostly Indian), and black slaves. Slavery in some Latin American countries, including Brazil, existed until the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>After independence, the Latin American country except Brazil, were proclaimed republics. Brazil became a republic only in 1889. Power in these countries tend to be owned by chiefs (kaudilio), which relied on the army and landowners. In the countries formally preserved constitution, representative bodies (parliaments) imituvalosya the election. This situation led to the weakness of state power. Numerous military coups, civil wars, establish personal dictatorships became a feature of political life in Latin America. The leaders of the national liberation struggle of the peoples of Latin America dreamed of being a single state that would unite all of Spanish America: population spoke similar languages, they are united by one religion - Catholicism. But that did not happen because of the selfishness of local elites who wanted to be rulers of their own states. Begun the war that led to the disintegration of Great Colombia and the United Provinces of Central America. But the boundaries that have been established between the new states were artificial in most cases, leading to new conflicts. The largest of these were: the struggle for the independence of Uruguay and Argentina-Brazil War (1816-1828 gg.) Paraґvayska bloodiest war (1864-1870 gg.) "Nitric" war of Chile with Peru and Bolivia (1870-1884 gg.).</p>
<p>The domination of landowners determined predominantly agrarian character of these countries. It certainly put them dependent on industrialized countries - first Britain and the US, and later the United States and Germany. They provide Latin American manufactured goods, capital, and were the main markets for their products. Strengthening the US position in the region has led to the fact that the ruling circles of the United States began to consider their southern neighbors as a natural extension of the US market. The situation is further strengthened US after the Spanish-American War in 1898, when Spain lost its last possessions in the region - Cuba and Puerto Rico, and the construction of the Panama Canal (1904-1914 gg.). -the Late nineteenth early twentieth century. US has repeatedly used military force to protect its interests in the region.</p>
<p>Countries had monocultural nature. In Argentina dominated the production of meat and grains, Brazil and Colombia - coffee, Cuba - sugar and tobacco in Central American countries -tropichnyh fruit, which gave reason to call the last "banana republics."</p>
<p>The combination of political sovereignty and economic dependence has become an important feature of the region.</p>
<p>However, this situation began to change from the late nineteenth century. As the region developed its own industry, and accordingly, the national capital and the working class, whose interests were contradict the interests of landowners.</p>
<p>This has turned the democratic movements that supported the strengthening of national sovereignty and democracy. Growing anti-American sentiment.</p>
<p>The most striking example of the anti-dictatorial regimes, the domination of landowners and foreign capital has become a revolution in Mexico (1910-1917 gg.).</p>
<p>The main driving force of the revolution were the peasant rebel army led by peasant leaders of Villa and Zapata.</p>
<p>The result was the adoption of most democratic revolution at the time in the world of the Constitution (1917), and guaranteeing social rights. Mexico has achieved limited impact landowners (land reform was implemented) and strengthened sovereignty (limiting the influence of foreign capital).</p>
<p>Conquests of the revolution provided a stable political development of Mexico to the present.</p>
