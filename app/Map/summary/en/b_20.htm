<p>Biological resources consist of plant and animal resources. The relationship between the biomass of flora and fauna shown in pie chart.</p>
<p>Plant resources are wild and cultivated plants. Cultivated plants in the world is much smaller than wild. On this map shows the eight centers of origin of cultivated plants which were isolated and examined by Academician MI Vavilov. For each of the centers are examples of plants, originating in a territory.</p>
<p>Wild plants are mainly concentrated in the woods and make forest resources. The forests around the globe form two zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>north - forests of temperate and subtropical climatic zones, which is dominated by conifers;</li>
<li>south - subekvatorialnoho forests and equatorial zones of deciduous tree species.</li>
</ul>
<p>Countries that lie outside the forest zones, suffer from lack of forest resources.</p>
<p>Indicators of forest resources area is forested (the ratio between the area and the total area of ​​forests as a percentage) and supplies of wood. The average forest cover in the world is 30%. In South America, this figure reaches 52%, and in North Africa and the Gulf just 1-5%.</p>
<p>The largest forests are concentrated in Russia, Canada, Brazil, United States.</p>
<p>The area of ​​forests of the northern zone of the mid XIX century. not significantly decreased, but the forests of the southern zone quickly disappear. The causes desolation green lung of the planet is slash and burn farming system, increasing the volume of exports of wood and using wood as fuel.</p>
