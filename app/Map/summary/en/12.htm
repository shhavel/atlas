<p>During the years of civil war, the territory of Ukraine suffered heavy damage. Losses of Ukraine are estimated at 10 billion rubles. With 11 thousand. Enterprises to 1921 were able to reopen the 2.5 thousand. The greatest loss suffered Donets Basin, metallurgical, engineering, sugar, salt and other industries.</p>
<p>Constant change of power in Ukraine, requisition, extortions led to the ruin of agriculture. The policy of "war communism" that it was carried out by the Bolsheviks, led to deterioration of the socio-economic status of farmers. 1920 requisitioning in Ukraine was performed at 40%. In Ukraine imposed excessively high food tax, a third of which (28.5 million tons of grain) were taken to Russia. The economic problems added hunger 1921-1923 gg., Which has infected about 15% of Ukraine's population (3.8 million).</p>
<p>Difficult for the Soviet regime remained the political situation. Most of Ukraine was seized by the peasant rebel movement.</p>
<p>In March 1921 the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) declared a policy of holding the New Economic Policy (NEP). All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee and Sovnarkom USSR adopted a number of directives aimed at the specification of objectives of the NEP in Ukraine. Their Cut was to replace the food layouts food tax. Now the peasants seized not all residues, a pre-set minimum tax. Paying tax in kind, farmers were able to sell surplus production. The government temporarily abandoned the establishment of collective farms. Quickly revived cooperation. It encompassed nearly 85% of farmers. NEP in the countryside yet. 1927 in Ukraine processed 10% more land than 1913 If 1917 basic lands in the hands of landlords and "kulaks", over the years of the NEP Ukrainian village was largely middle, distinguished and wealthy owners, including which were many former Red, Red partisans active participants in the struggle for Soviet power.</p>
<p>Existed in Ukraine and the system of collective farms - farms and communes. They created their predominantly poor, rural communists and Komsomol members. However, farms were combined for only 1.2% of farms and took 1.4% of the land area.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1925 the sown area in Ukraine amounted to 95% compared to 1913, and gross grain indices reached the last pre-war years.</p>
<p>The industry returned to former owners selected after 1917 small production, encouraged foreign investment. In Ukraine, there were many private schools. Was allowed to set up their own factories and plants take in rent previously nationalized enterprises.</p>
<p>In households Ukraine increased productivity, increased arable land, upgraded production of consumer goods.</p>
<p>During the NEP increased role of commodity-money relations. State-owned enterprises were transferred to economic calculation. Likvidovuvalasya equality in pay, which has been dependent on the number and quality of products, as well as saving fuel, raw materials, streamlining manufacturing.</p>
<p>Important role in the rise of the national economy played held in the country monetary reform (October 1922). In turn was introduced bank ticket, which was 10 gold rubles - "ducat". First, the new currency was used to calculate between state enterprises, and from 1924 it was possible to go to the "gold piece" in its entirety.</p>
<p>Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin argued that the NEP will bring the country out of crisis, and the Soviets only get stronger, because all the commanding heights of the economy remains in state hands. Large companies, banks, transport, foreign trade did not change ownership.</p>
<p>Rebuilding industry began with the conversion of existing factories on economic calculation. To resolve the economic issues of the enterprise together sectoral, territorial and sectoral - in trusts. First trusts appeared in the fall 1921 as in heavy industry ("Donvuhillya", "Pivdenstal", "Pivdennorudnyy Trust"), and in the light ("Tekstyltrest", "Shkirtrest", "Tsukortrest"). At the beginning of 1922 Ukrainian national economy glad to have obeyed the 24 trusts, which brings together around 450 companies of all industries.</p>
<p>To make a trade, procurement of raw materials, marketing of similar products were formed syndicates.</p>
<p>The Communist Party tried to use for building the economy of labor enthusiasm of the workers and peasants. Gained popularity Saturdays and Sundays, the days of high-powered work more.</p>
<p>Urban residents experienced significant positive effects of the NEP, which quickly emerged in the denationalization of trade and industry, the formation of a significant number of new, stimulating economic activity of the population, especially small producers. In the village became the order of tens of thousands dairies, various types of mills (steam, water, wind-driven) enterprises for the production of sausages, smoked meats, various marinades.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties vidbudovchyh period 1925 - 1926 gg., In most industries Ukraine reached the level of 1913 (but those were light and food industries).</p>
<p>The success of reconstruction helped to implement the plan DEELRO (n. HOÐ­LRO) (electrification of the country), which was adopted in 1920 it was decided to start construction Dnieper, the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe. Overall, Ukraine has built 50 power plants, including Kharkiv, Lugansk, Poltava, Donetsk, which exceeded the plan by 2 times.</p>
<p>However, the policy of the NEP is not entailed political change. Republic still had formal sovereignty and dictated from Moscow to perform the task. No change in Party building. Communist Party of Ukraine remains one of the units of the RCP (B).</p>
<p>Attempts by the opposition Ukrainian Communist Party (UCP) to unite with the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and create an independent organization ended dissolution of the UCP.</p>
<p>The NEP also had political implications. He meant the failure of the policy of War Communism and the need to stimulate "Bolshevik onslaught." The gradual recovery of economic life, the expansion of commodity production by small businesses or Nepmen led to reconciliation Ukrainian peasants with the Bolshevik regime that contributed to its establishment in Ukraine.</p>

<ul>
<li>"External" origin policy, which does not take into account the national interests of Ukrainian;</li>
<li>social and economic transformation was accompanied by suppression of the national-democratic forces;</li>
<li>implementation of the NEP began much later than in other republics.</li>
