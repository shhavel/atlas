<p><b>The Russian state in the XVII - XVIII Art.</b></p>
<p>After the death of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich in the throne appeared just two king Ivan V and Peter I. However, until 1689 the country was ruled their older sister Sofia. All her attempts to gain a foothold on the throne were unsuccessful. Finally the king of the Muscovite state was Peter I.</p>
<p>During the reign of Peter were implemented radical reforms, which brought the country to a new stage of development and affected almost all aspects of social life.</p>
<p>Transformations extend to public management system, army, economy, culture, daily life, social relations.</p>
<p>All these reforms were implemented without a predetermined plan, they spontaneously, sometimes under the pressure of external circumstances, and sometimes from the personal will of Peter. But their goal was to achieve a strategic input in the number of Russian great power to influence the course of events in the world.</p>
<p>One of the first actions of the young king was the continuation of the war with Turkey for access to the Black Sea. But having made two Azov campaigns 1695, 1696, and captured the fortress of Azov at the mouth of the Don, he realized the futility of this direction of its foreign policy.</p>
<p>After a trip to Europe, Peter became clear that in order to achieve the main goal would be the best start of the war with Sweden in order to obtain access to the Baltic Sea to world trade routes. The outbreak of war was a failure for Peter, his army was defeated at Narva and its allies Denmark, Saxony, Poland defeated by the talented Swedish King Karl XII.</p>
<p>Lesions only prompted Peter to drastic measures to establish efficient army and navy. Decisively, sometimes too cruel methods king created a new army and provided her with all necessary to build a military manufactory in the Urals and in the center of the country. The turning point in the war came after the battle of Poltava, in her Swedes led by Charles XII and the Ukrainian, supporters of Ivan Mazepa, defeated.</p>
<p>Inspired by the victory of Peter makes adventurous Prut campaign in possession of the Ottoman Empire, but was soundly defeated, giving the Turks all that once they have captured. However, at the front with the Swedes accompanied him success. Victory in sea battles at Cape Gangut (1714) and the island Grengam (1720) finally persuaded Sweden to the world.

<p>After the victory in the Great Northern War, Peter October 20, 1721 was proclaimed emperor, and Russia - the empire.</p>
<p>Northern War opened Russia to the Baltic Sea. Gain weight in European affairs, the empire again sent predatory aspirations in all directions.</p>
<p>The victory went to Russia a high price: the war and the king's reform cost the country a quarter of the population. But the Russian tsars, both in the past and in the future were not considered life of his subjects for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Reform of the king contributed to the formation of absolutism in Russia. After the death of Peter I of his undertaking is not well established, resulting in the further a series of palace coups. The struggle was between the various factions of nobles, who sought to fix and increase the privilege. After the entry of Peter I's daughter Elizabeth to the throne of the situation in the country stabilized somewhat. She continued the course of his father strengthening power of the monarch in the country and prestige in the international arena. In the reign of Elizabeth Russia entered the Seven Years' War (1756-1762 AD), becoming the determining factor in the course of events. Although Russia has not received any territorial gains (the successor of Elizabeth Peter IRS refused all conquests in favor of his idol Frederick II King of Prussia), it demonstrated its military power and consolidated authority in Europe. Without Russia has not been solved, no important international business.</p>

However, her reign reflected new burdens for the tax-paying population: increased taxes, the peasants were enslaved, to eliminate any liberties (elimination of Hetman (1764), Zaporizhzhya Sich (1775) in Ukraine).</p>
<p>Strengthening oppression of peasants, workers, Cossacks led to the outbreak of the most powerful in the history of Russian peasant war led by Pugachev (1773-1775 AD), the second in the XVIII century. (First under the leadership of K. Bulavina 1707-1709 years), which covered large areas of the Urals, the Volga, Don.</p>
<p>Catherine II pursued an active foreign policy. Its main areas are: the fight against the Ottoman Empire for the Black Sea coast, strengthening the position of the Baltic, the content under control of Poland. In all these areas, Catherine has made great progress. As a result, the two Russian-Turkish war of 1768-1774 and of 1787-1791 Russia established itself on the Black Sea coast, has eliminated the Crimean Khanate. Inflicted the final defeat of Sweden (1788-1790 years), reducing it to a category of minor states.</p>
