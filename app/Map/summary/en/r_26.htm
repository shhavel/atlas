<p>The mainland South America with North America are part of the world America. Area in South America, along with the islands - 17 830 thousand. Km square. The continent is in the Western Hemisphere relative to the zero meridian. With respect to the equator most of it is in the Southern Hemisphere, smaller - North.</p>
<p>South America is washed by two oceans: the east - the Atlantic in the west - the Pacific.</p>
<p>The coastline is broken slightly, large bays are only in the south-east coast (La Plata, San Jorge, Bahia Grande) and the south-west coast are many small islands, straits and inlets with steep rocky shores. Atlantic Ocean south of the city. Horn is connected to the Pacific Ocean Drake Passage. Numerous islands (most of which Chiloe and Tierra del Fuego), bays and straits are only in the south Pacific coast of the mainland.</p>
<p>The height of the continent above sea level of 590 m, maximum - 6959 m (Aconcagua g), the lowest - 42 m below sea level. Shape of the continent due to its tectonic structure. In ancient South American Precambrian platform are Amazon, La Plata and Orinokska lowlands. North of the Amazon basin on the crystalline shield is the Guiana Plateau. To the east of the continent is a large area of ​​Brazilian plateau, is also associated with exits to the surface of the crystalline rocks of the Precambrian platform. On the Pacific coast stretch young high Andes Mountains, which formed during the epoch of the Cenozoic orogeny. In northern Andes have a height of over 5000 meters and near the equator they reach 6 or more thousand meters.</p>
<p>In the Andes, is the highest peak of the continent h Aconcagua. From her south mountain gradually reduced. Andes Cordillera along with North America forming the eastern part of the Pacific seismic belt. In the south of the continent, east of the Andes, Patagonia lies with elevations ranging from 500 to 3000 m. This geographic region shaped by horoutvoryuvalnyh era Baikal folding process, which in individual cells rejuvenated structures cover the Precambrian platform.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous in surface height mainland dismembered powerful river systems, the largest of which is a system of rivers in the Amazon. Amazon (with Maranon) is the second river of the world's longest, and its pool area - the largest in the world (more than 7 million km sq.). Amazon flows through the entire continent from west to east. In the Orinoco river system is the highest in the world Angel Falls. On the west coast of the mainland rivers are few and they are not very long.</p>
<p>Andes Cordillera of North America make up the eastern part of the Pacific seismic belt. Processes of mountain building, accompanied by faults, volcanoes and destructive earthquakes occur today.</p>
<p>The tropical part of the continent washed by the warm waters, creating favorable conditions for the formation of coral reefs. From the south along the Pacific coast of mainland cools the Peruvian current, and along the Atlantic coast - Falklands. Also cold flow westerly winds in the Drake Passage casts ice floating off the coast of the mainland of Antarctica towards not only in summer but also in winter. On the mainland ice phenomena observed at high altitudes even in summer. Wetlands and wetlands are characteristic of La Plata lowland Delta. Orinoco and the north-east coast of the continent. In South America, is the most droughty Atacama desert planet.</p>
