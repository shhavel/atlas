<p>Environmental problems have arisen as a result of human interaction with the environment.</p>
<p>In the second ladle of the twentieth century. due to excessive human impact on nature in many countries and regions of the world environmental situation has reached a level of ecological crisis - stress state between man and nature as extremely altered by human nature begins to sharply negative impact on the social development and there is a threat to the existence of the human species. This is a reversible condition in which humanity, subject to timely respond adequately, can still remedy the situation.</p>
<p>The map shows the area that environmental assessment under the criteria referred to areas of ecological crisis:</p>
<p>areas of the oceans, polluted due to the transportation of petroleum products and other forms of economic activity;</p>
<p>Areas dumping industrial waste in the oceans;</p>
<p>areas decrease in forest area as a result of industrial logging in the Northern Hemisphere and areas of destruction of tropical forests;</p>
<p>areas of greatest risk of desertification.</p>
<p>State of ecological crisis is typical of most big cities - industrial and transportation centers in the world. It almost destroyed the natural landscape and recorded excessively high level of pollution of all components of the environment.</p>
<p>By areas of radioactive contamination are places nuclear weapons tests: the atolls of the Pacific Ocean, the Gobi desert (China), Nevada in the US, about. Novaya Zemlya (Russia), radioactive waste disposal sites and places where the accident occurred nuclear ships, as well as areas that have been contaminated as a result of accidents at nuclear power plants (US, Russia, Ukraine).</p>
<p>In the world there is a territory whose status can be described as an ecological disaster - the abnormal state of nature, resulting from human activities, which led to extremely negative consequences or increased morbidity and mortality. An example of an environmental catastrophe is the area of ​​the accident at Chernobyl (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia) and the Urals region (Russia), where in the last decades of the twentieth century. as a result of the depletion and pollution of water and air dramatically worsened the living conditions of the population.</p>
<p>Environmental concerns relate to the whole of humanity. Therefore, they can be solved only by joint efforts. In 1992, the International Environmental Forum representatives of 179 countries took important document of our time - Humanity in Action Programme of the XXI century., In which the ways of international cooperation in this century to improve the quality of the environment and to achieve a high standard of living of the population of the planet.</p>
