<p>Map Minerals designed to detect relationships geostructures of complex minerals, which are the basis for the extractive industries in Ukraine. The mineral resources of Ukraine - one of the world's richest mineral deposits on the range (120 species) - represented by fuel (coal, oil, gas, oil shale, peat), metal (iron, manganese, nickel, titanium, uranium, chrome, gold ) and non-metallic (rock salt, kaolin, fire clay, cement raw materials, flux limestone, etc.) minerals. This amount is sufficient to develop the country's industries oriented to the use of domestic raw materials.</p>
<p>Today in Ukraine explored 94 minerals and developed 8,000 deposits. Of particular importance to the economy with manganese (75% stocks CIS), iron (31%), titanium (40%) of ore, coal (25%), native sulfur (80%), kaolin (60%), graphite (50%) and refractory clay (35%). The main coal basin countries are Donetsk (Donbass), whose reserves are estimated at 109 billion tons.</p>
<p>Despite the location in Ukraine two provinces and two oil and gas fields, oil and gas production does not cover the country's needs. These energy sources are imported from Russia and Turkmenistan. However, the Black Sea-Crimean province are promising for the discovery of new oil and gas fields, while others require new extraction technologies.</p>
<p>Rog Iron and Nikopol manganese pools are among the largest in the world.</p>
<p>Among non-ferrous metal ore deposits are unique deposits of titanium ores in Zhytomyr and Dnipropetrovsk regions and explored new gold deposits in the Carpathians. For mercury ore reserves (Mykytivskomufield in the Donbass) our country - one of the leaders in the world. One of the leading places in the world and Ukraine holds reserves of metallic minerals:</p>
<p>- Deposits of native sulfur and wax (Precarpathians) - the largest in the world;</p>
<p>- Reserves of granite and labradorite (Zhytomyr) Ukraine ahead of the competition in Europe.</p>
<p>In our state, and deposits of precious and semi-precious stones (beryl, amethyst, amber, jasper, rock crystal) in Kryvorizhia, Azov, Crimea and Transcarpathia.</p>
<p>All kinds of minerals make up a strong base mining industry.</p>
<p>Extraction of essential minerals in 2006 was:</p>
<p>coal - 61.7 million tons of oil - 4.6 million tons</p>
<p>gas - 21.1 billion cubic meters. of iron ore - 74 million tons</p>
<p>manganese ore - 3.1 million tons of uranium ore - 800 tons.</p>
<p>Food production for the operation of such industries as energy, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, chemical industry, glass, porcelain and faience industry and building materials industry. Mineral waters and muds are used both in the sphere of material production (industrial mineral water), as well as in health care.</p>
<p>Available resources of some minerals far exceed their needs of the economy of Ukraine.</p>
