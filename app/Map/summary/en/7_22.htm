<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. Location of Kievan Rus' and Galicia-Volyn principality in the history of the Ukrainian people</b></p>
<p>Research language, life, customs and obryadiv rusychiv 10-13 century. on the territory of Kyiv, Chernihivschyny, Galicia and Volyn Region - central lands of Kievan Rus' and Galicia-Volyn principality - give reason to call them davnimy Ukrainian.</p>
<p>The roots of our people - in East Slavic tribes who during the 5-7 centuries. actively settled on new land.</p>
<p>The first East Slavic state - Kievan Rus - was a medieval empire.</p>
<p>Along with old Ukrainian - constituent, the dominant people - it lived and others - Slavic and Baltic, Finnish, Turkic peoples.</p>
<p>Ukrainians from closer co-existence in one state with them were able to clearly understand their distinctiveness, dissimilarity to other nations, which ultimately helped to shape the minds of the people, or as they say the researchers, national identity.</p>
<p>The immediate successor of Kievan Rus' was the Galicia-Volyn principality.</p>
<p>Formed in 1199 by Roman Mstislavovich, it served as the backbone of the Ukrainian state in the next century and lasted until 1340</p>
<p>Saved Galicia-Volhynia Ukrainian state traditions were perceived Ukrainian nobility and later the Cossacks, and revived in the Ukrainian Cossack state.</p>
<p>That is why prominent Ukrainian historian Mykhailo Grushevskii argued that Galicia-Volhynia directly inherited political and cultural traditions of the Prince of Kyiv.</p>
<p>Thus, the significance of Kievan Rus - state created Ukrainian people for the princely stage of its history, according to the same Hrushevsky, is that it is the first form of Ukrainian statehood.</p>
<p><b>2. Origin and distribution of the name "Ukraine"</b></p>
<p>The name was first used Ukraine, in Kiev chronicles during 1187</p>
<p>That year in bytvi against Polovtsian died Pereyaslav Prince Vladimir Hlibovych.</p>
<p>Sadly announcing that event chronicler recorded that the prince "a lot potuzhyla Ukraine."</p>
<p>Researchers say that in those chasiv name "Ukraine" extended to the Kyiv region, Pereyaslav and Chernihivschynu.</p>
<p>During 1189 in the same chronicles taken the name "Galician Ukraine" to the Galician knyazivstva.</p>
<p>On the origin of the name Ukraine there exists several assumptions.</p>
<p>However, most associate researcher of the name of in Ukraine by "the uttermost part of the country" in the value of the "Native land, country land."</p>
<p><b>3. The origin and development of national symbols</b></p>
<p>The main element emblem Ukraine - Trident - was a sign of Prince Rurik dynasty inherited from earlier chasiv.</p>
<p>This is testified by the oldest archaeological finds images trident, which they classed to 1 tbsp. n. e.</p>
<p>Images of trident Nayvidomishe period of Kievan Rus' - images on coins Volodymyr the Great.</p>
<p>In general the generic sign for several centuries was distributed in all knyazivstvah Kievan Rus, always keeping the value of the symbol of power of the prince.</p>
<p>This princely ancestral character is passed by inheritance intact, as is the case with the arms (emblem sign is the transfer of his descendants in the steady state form), and each new prince image added to any changes.</p>
<p>There's a 40 version, which explain its history. Some people believe that this sign is borrowed from the peoples, neighbors, other - it spokonvichnyy symbol of our ancestors.</p>
<p>For the princely strife - Trident - lost national importance.</p>
<p>Each prince sought to create their own symbols, which subsequently entrenched in the coats of arms of Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>In Kiev land trident superseded images of St. Archangel Michael, who was considered the patron saint of soldiers and a symbol of victory.</p>
<p>A new sign has been extended in the early 12th century. Archangel Michael was a spiritual patron of the Grand Duke Svjatopolka-Michael II, who built in his honor St. Michael's Cathedral in Kiev.</p>
<p>The eldest son of Vladimir Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kyiv Mstislav used stamp with the image of St. Michael.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the image of Archangel Michael with princely seals moved to the city emblem.</p>
<p>The heyday of the Galicia-Volyn principality reached and the arms of the modern city.</p>
<p>Lion symbolizing courage, power, courage, generosity.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that the sign of the lion as the emblem could take Lev Danilovich. His grandson, Leo Yu, also enjoyed it.</p>
<p>According to scientists, the lion was the emblem of Galician principality.</p>
<p>The oldest documented certified lion in the emblem of the city meet to seal applied to the document 1359</p>
<p><b>Flags, banners</b></p>
<p>Flag Rus looked like elongated triangles.</p>
<p>With 168 images of flags in Radzyvilivskomu chronicles 147 certifying red tint banner.</p>
<p>The rest - blue, green, white and brawn. With the introduction of Christianity in the cloth flags were pictured saints - patrons of a certain prince or land and princely signs, crosses, sun, stars.</p>
<p>During the fragmentation of a proliferation of rectangular flags.</p>
<p>When the lands were fixed arms, they were repeated on the flags.</p>
<p><b>4. The international significance of Kievan Rus' and Galicia-Volyn state</b></p>
