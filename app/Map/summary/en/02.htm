<p>Political map of the world shows the placement of states and dependent territories, showing existing boundaries, capitals and major cities of the planet. In a world of over 240 countries and territories. Of these, more than 200 - sovereign states, ie, political independence of the country. Country - a territory with defined boundaries, populated by certain people, who in the political and geographical terms can have sovereignty (independence), or be a dependent. Around the world there is still more than 40 dependent territories (colonies), each of which is under the political or military control of one of the sovereign states (Gibraltar, New Caledonia, Bermuda, etc.). The proportion of dependent territories in area and population is less than 2%.</p>
<p>PKM changed the course of history from the emergence of the first states to its modern look. This time is conventionally divided into 4 periods:</p>
<p>antique (to V in.)</p>
<p>Medieval (V-XV centuries).</p>
<p>Colonial (XV-early XX centuries).</p>
<p>newest (XX - beginning of XXI centuries).</p>
<p>To imagine the formation of PKM in the recent period, presented three maps:</p>
<p>"The World in 1914"</p>
<p>"The World in 1961"</p>
<p>"The political map of the world"</p>
<p>Map of "The World in 1914" demonstrates the political picture on the eve of the First World War, while there were only 55 sovereign states and vast colonial empires of France, Britain, Portugal; The Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, German and Russian Empire.</p>
<p>On the map "The World in 1961" are taken into account political changes after the two world wars and the fall of colonial empires. In the mid-twentieth century. on the site of the former colonies arose over a hundred independent countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania.</p>
<p>Comparing these maps, we can observe the continuity of the processes accompanying the history of mankind. With time came and went great civilization arose and destroyed the mighty empire, and once the secondary colonies became influential in the state.</p>
<p>Largest state by population is China (over 1.35 billion people), the world leader in population growth is India: population increases every year by about 15-18 million. Mongolia - the largest state in area, which has no outlet to the sea. In addition to such giants as Russia, China, India, the United States in the world there are states that on the area and the number of the population does not differ from ordinary towns (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino). And the smallest state, the Vatican, has an area of ​​0.44 km2.</p>
