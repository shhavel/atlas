<p>In a world with the development of civilization, there is a general upward trend in life expectancy, but among countries, this figure is substantially different. Thus, in developed countries, it is the highest (75 years and more), and in developing countries - less than 60 years.</p>
<p>Among developing countries, higher life expectancy allocated the newly industrialized countries of Asia and Latin America, the rich countries are oil exporters (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Libya, Brunei), and prosperous Caribbean island, Seychelles and Reunion (France) in the Indian Ocean, Nauru, Guam (US), and some others - in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The lowest life expectancy - in most African countries. This is due to the extremely low overall life on the continent, inadequate medical care, part of the military and ethnic conflicts.</p>
<p>Sex composition of the population - is the ratio of men and women who depend on the biological, historical and social reasons. Globally, men slightly more than women. Among the countries where the predominant male half of the population - China, India, Turkey. The predominance of women in these countries due to the historically disadvantaged position of women (early marriage, early and multiple births, especially mentality, etc.).</p>
<p>In most countries, the situation is reversed. Especially noticeable predominance of women in countries that actively participated in the Second World War and other military conflicts. Genetically, the female life expectancy by 5-8 years longer than men.</p>
<p>Addition to the map are the corresponding diagrams (pyramids), which are presented together with a map of "distribution of the population." Polovovozrastnye pyramid shows the ratio of male and female population by age group as a percentage. Pyramid is for individual countries to a certain year. There are two types of age structure of the population, who are responsible type of population reproduction. The first (regressive) type of age structure is formed at the constriction (I) type of reproduction of the population. A characteristic feature for him is a small proportion of young people (under 15) and a significant portion of older people (over 55-65 years). This distribution of population by age is inherent mainly developed countries (Japan, USA). The second (progressive) type of age structure are developing countries with advanced (ii) the type of population reproduction. Here is a very significant proportion of children and adolescents at the lowest part of the elderly population (India).</p>
