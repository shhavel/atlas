<p>Symbols, which are used to image objects in terms of geographic area can be divided into four distinct groups: contour, line, and explanatory icons.</p>
<p>Outlined symbols convey the true shape and size of the object on the scale of the plan, they consist of a circuit, performed color or shading (forest, garden, marsh, sand, lake, large river, reservoir, etc.).</p>
<p>Linear symbols on the plan used to image linear objects (roads, trails, streams, power lines and communications, etc.). The length of these objects and their location is shown on the scale and width - usually is slightly increased.</p>
<p>Badges symbols sometimes called pozamasshtabnymy, because they are used when the form object because of its small size, can be shown to scale. In such cases, use the icons with resemble real objects (windmill, watermill, source, rare conifers and deciduous trees, silos, etc.).</p>
<p>Explanatory symbols are used for essential additional information about topography. First is the names of settlements, rivers, lakes, streams, islands. There on the plans and abbreviated names of objects (HQ. - School of Art. - Station of Forestry. - House forester, etc.) Or uppercase letters (PA - sandy bottom, D. - wooden bridge, K . - well). By the explanatory signs also include numbers that characterize the different topography (height of hills, river width and depth, rate of flow, the characteristics of bridges, height and thickness of the trees in the forest, etc.).</p>
