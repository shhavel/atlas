<p>This map is a supplement to map environmental problems. It can be used to characterize the problem of environmental pollution, including pollution of the atmosphere and the effects of the greenhouse effect. The essence of the greenhouse effect is that the atmosphere is almost completely skips solar radiation to the Earth. A large part is reflected from the earth's surface radiation (mainly infrared rays) delayed atmospheric gases near the surface of the planet. This creates excessive heat, most of which are negative effects of melting glaciers, raising sea levels and the consequent flooding of coastal areas.</p>
<p>Main pollutants are gaseous impurities (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, freons) are emitted into the atmosphere due to the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, as well as a mountain, building and other land works.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are called greenhouse gases because getting into the atmosphere, they increase the greenhouse effect, while creating the Earth that temperature at which there may be biological life (approximately 15 ° C). Together with other gases, they constitute an atmosphere that has existed for millions of years, providing suitable conditions for living organisms, and protects the Earth from overheating and overcooling. Since the 50's. The twentieth century. atmospheric balance broken by a sharp increase in revenues of greenhouse gases. The main source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is road transport and thermal power.</p>
<p>On the map shows that the highest CO2 emissions by industrial enterprises accounted for economically developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere. In China and India's CO2 emissions result from the burning of large quantities of fossil fuels, and in Brazil an additional source of CO2 are often fires in tropical forests. Methane to the atmosphere by burning biomass from rice fields and the cattle.</p>
<p>Freons - gases of anthropogenic origin - are used in refrigerators, air conditioners, as solvents, sprays, detergents and so on. The increase of CFCs in the atmosphere leads to the destruction of atmospheric ozone and ozone depletion, the emergence of the so-called ozone hole.</p>
<p>Changing the gas balance of the atmosphere is the cause of increase in mean annual air temperature in the lower atmosphere at 0,5-1 ° C and, therefore, global warming, increasing the length of the dry period in the northern hemisphere (registered in the United States, Russia, China).</p>
<p>Illiteracy</p>
<p>The proportion of illiterates in the population of a country depends on many factors: historical traditions, mentality, education spending. In economically developed countries account for 4% of the adult illiterate population, for developing countries, accounting for more than 9/10 illiterate world. In developing countries, a large regional differences in this indicator. So in Africa, more than half the adult population is illiterate.</p>
<p>In East Asia - 1/4, and in Latin America, about 1/6. More than half of the world's illiterate falls on India and China - two nayzalyudnenishi country.</p>
<p>In addition to basic literacy and there is functional illiteracy, ie the inability of humans to orient and adapt to technological changes taking place in society; understand the necessary explanations relating to employment; inability to use the Information Network and others. Functional illiteracy in highly developed countries is a major cause of failure in the provision of employers.</p>
