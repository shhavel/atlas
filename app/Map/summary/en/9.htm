According to the agreement between the governments of the UPR and UGA ZUNR joined the UNR Army to continue joint struggle for Ukraine's independence under the slogan "In Kiev Kyiv through!".

Along the left bank of Dnipro in Kyiv to take part of the Volunteer Army under General delusional. Trying to come to terms with Denikin was not successful, and the Ukrainian part were forced to withdraw to Boryspil. Filing Kyiv was tantamount to defeat. This event became known as the "Kyiv catastrophe." Ukrainians have lost the character of an independent state. The moral and psychological defeat added and other problems: between Ukrainian and volunteer army fighting began, while the Polish army captured West dawdle, depriving the Ukrainian army rear; Army struck by an epidemic of typhus and other diseases and as a result, the amount was reduced by 70%.</p>
<p>The first armed resistance had ceased UGA, which after separate talks moved to the side of Denikin. E. Petrushevych went to Vienna. Directory collapsed. Army Petliura some time resisted. Once in the environment, the remains of the Ukrainian army switched to guerrilla fighting methods. Gen. M. Pavlenko Omelianovych-led troops raided parts of the UPR, which moved tylamy Denikin forces and the Red Army (the raid went down in history as the first "winter campaign" (December 1919 - May 1920)).</p>

At the head of each executive standing with unlimited powers. Politics Denikin in the Ukraine was held under the banner of restoring "Great Russia". Ukrainian national movement was proclaimed treacherous and suffered persecution. The name "Ukraine" was banned. Violent repression awaited all who zapidozryuvavsya in opposition to the regime. The industry and the countryside began to revive the old order: the companies canceled all the gains of the revolution, the village restored landlord economy. With the punitive expeditions of the peasants confiscated buildings, implements, livestock. According to the law of the harvest in 1919 the peasants had to give one-third of the harvest to the landlords. Was also introduced tax - 5 pounds of grain from each tithing to the needs of the army. Delays and evasion is punishable by death. These orders led to an explosion of popular discontent, strikes and workers' uprising, the deployment of mass peasant movement (guerrilla movement units N. Makhno and other otamans), which Denikin could not cope. All Denikin's successes at the front against the Bolsheviks was reversed total collapse of their rear. Finally in October 1919 the Red Army inflicted on Denikin's counter-attack. After fierce fighting their main forces were defeated (Corps skins and Mammoth) and the remnants of Denikin, retreating at the beginning of 1920 entrenched in the Crimea. Denikin resigned from the duties of commander in chief. With the defeat of Denikin of the UGA find themselves in a difficult position, and in February 1920 sided with the Bolsheviks. The connection is called Red Ukrainian Galician Army (Chugay).</p>
<p>Thus, fighting the second half of 1919 led to the third coming of the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine. The main opponents of the Bolsheviks: UNR Army and Volunteer Army of General Denikin were defeated.</p>
