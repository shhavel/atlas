<p>Occupation regime in Ukraine</p>
<p>Even before the war the Nazi command sketching out the future structure of the conquered territories to the east. It had to be special administrative entities - Reichscommisariat - directly subordinate to Hitler's SS Hitler. In September 1941 began to operate two Reichscommisariat "Ostland", which included the Baltic States and Belarus, and "Ukraine", which included Volhynia, Right Bank, Poltava and the lower Dnieper. Reichskommissariat "Ukraine" was divided into 6 general districts (heneralbetsyrkiv): Volhynia and Podolia, Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Taurus. Nazi administration of occupied Ukraine was in Rivne. Eastern Galicia incorporated in the General Governorship (Poland). It was seen as an integral part of Greater Germany. By Galicians as a former Austrian subjects, the ratio was slightly softer than the population of the Reich Commissariat. But the future was supposed to colonize the land of the Germans and Ukrainian and Polish relocate to the east. Transcarpathia is from 1939 was a part of Hungary. Romania as an ally of Germany, in 1941 regained Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. July 19 was signed German-Romanian agreement on the transfer of the disposal of the Romanian Royal Government of the territory between the Dniester and Southern Bug River with the city of Odessa. This area was called "Transnistria" (Zadnestrovya). Pryfrontovi areas, which was part of Eastern Ukraine and Crimea are directly ruled by military authorities. In the future they plan to add to the Reich Commissariat.</p>
<p>The unprecedented victory of the German army eclipsed the mind of Hitler and his entourage. Plans for partial autonomy Slavic lands were rejected, the impression that the East can do anything they want, ignoring the rules of civilization and morality, which to some extent invaders tried to follow the event. Policies eastern territories gained in the execution plan "Ost" prepared in July 1941 assumed by all possible means to reduce the population of Ukraine and to prepare it for German colonization. Most people Nazis planned to deport the east, a smaller part - onimechchyty, the rest - to destroy. To this end, the Nazis covered the Ukraine network of concentration camps where hundreds of thousands were dying prisoners of war and civilians suspected of unreliability. Another brutal was the policy of the Germans about Jewish and Gypsy population, which was doomed to murder. In the field of Ancient Settlement of Jews in the cities and towns of Western Ukraine and Podolia, the Nazis created isolated, carefully vartovani ghetto. During the period of occupation of their inhabitants almost completely destroyed. Most mass shootings took place in Janow near Lviv in Babi Yar in Kiev, where he died populous Jewish communities of these cities. To carry out massacres Ukraine scoured special "aynzatshrupy" who ruthlessly eliminated "ideological and racial enemies."</p>
<p>Ukrainians used as gratuitous labor. Buildable portion of the population were taken to Germany, where the lack of workers in industry, agriculture and service. Farmers, as in Soviet times worked in farms, but now the fruits of their labor fed the German army and the citizens of the Reich. Over expression of even minor disobedience invaders burned entire villages with all residents. Townspeople starved and shot for any occasion. The invaders did not see the need for the existence of major cities in the conquered territories, it is contrary to their vision of postwar Eastern Europe as agricultural margin Reich.</p>
<p>The result of the occupation of Ukraine during the period of 1941 - 1945. Was to reduce its population by 14 million people (of which 8 million were killed). The cruelty of enemies spawned unprecedented in strength resistance movement that unfolded in proportion to the strengthening of the Nazi terror.</p>
