<p>Non-ferrous metallurgy - this industry, including the extraction of non-ferrous metals and the production of these metals and alloys. Deposits of non-ferrous metals are shown on the map, "Mineral resources".</p>
<p>The most common non-ferrous metals are arranged in groups:</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Light metals (aluminum, titanium, magnesium);</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Heavy metals (copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel);</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Precious metals (gold, silver, platinum);</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Alloying metals (tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Light metals are widely used for the manufacture of aerospace equipment, marine vessels and equipment for chemical plants. The demand for them is growing. The most common in the crust are rocks containing aluminum. Therefore, aluminum production is a major industry-ferrous metallurgy. The raw material for the production of aluminum is bauxite. Aluminum production consists of two stages. The first - the production of alumina (aluminum oxide), tends to bauxite mining areas. The second - the smelting of primary aluminum from alumina by electrolysis. Production of aluminum metal is quite energy-intensive, so it tends to be a source of electricity.</p>
<p>Alumina production is concentrated in Australia, Jamaica, China, Brazil, Russia - countries where there is a source of raw materials. Production of aluminum metal - in Russia, Australia, China and countries that aluminum is smelted from imported raw materials (Japan, Italy, Canada, Norway, Germany, Bahrain, UAE). Among exporting countries, Canada ranked first and produces the most cheapest aluminum.</p>
<p>Melting of heavy metals tends to sources of raw materials. Copper, tin, nickel mined mainly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In these countries, established the initial stages of metal production, extraction, refining, smelting crude metal, the so-called dirty production. The final stage of production (refining, alloys and getting rolled) is concentrated in the developed countries (USA, Japan, Western Europe).</p>
<p>Lead-zinc industry as feedstock uses ores. The largest producers of zinc and lead are the US, Canada, Japan, France, Mexico, Peru, Australia.</p>
