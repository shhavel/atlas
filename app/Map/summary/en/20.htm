<p>The most common mineral on Earth - is water. Water - a special substance that is in the three states of aggregation: solid (at temperatures below 0 ° C - snow and ice), liquid (at a temperature of 0 ° C to 100 ° C - clear liquid without taste and smell) and gaseous (at temperatures higher than 0 ° C - water vapor). Water is a part of all living organisms. The human body, for example, 65% of water. Fungi, algae and many other plants, especially those with a juicy fruit can contain up to 98% of the substance. In the world contains about 1.5 billion cubic kilometers of water, which forms a water shell of the planet - the hydrosphere. In the oceans and seas account for 97.4% water and only 2.6% - a fresh water. More than 3/4 of all fresh water is located in glaciers where it is in the solid state.</p>
<p>Almost a quarter of reserves of fresh water are groundwater, a significant share in the form of permafrost is also in the solid state. Only 280 thousand. Cubic kilometers - a land surface water (lakes, reservoirs, rivers, wetlands), 14 thousand. Cubic kilometers of fresh water is in the atmosphere in gaseous state.</p>
<p>Because water can move from one state to another in nature is a continuous process of moving of water from the oceans to the land, and on land - again in the oceans. This continuous process is called the water cycle. There are a small cycle when the water evaporates over the ocean, carried by a certain distance, and falls as rain on the other side of the ocean, or the great cycle when transferred to dry land from the ocean water returns to the ocean after, vypavshy as rain, flowing on the surface or seeps underground.</p>
<p>Water tends to expand when heated, cooling - compressed, but only to a temperature of 4 ° C. With further cooling, turning to ice water again increased in volume by almost a third. Getting in the cracks of rocks and freezing with decreasing temperature, the water expands, destroying rocks and changing terrain. This process is part of weathering - the destruction. Water is a good solvent, it dissolves but not all substances. The best variety of water-soluble salts, gypsum, limestone. Because these soluble rocks in the earth's crust is pretty much underground water often washes away cavity, causing the formation on the surface of failures. Dissolved salt water through the water cycle fall into the oceans and accumulate there because sea water contains much more salt water than land. The water that does not contain salt, can only be obtained in the laboratory. In nature, the entire water, even fresh, contains salts that give it a certain flavor.</p>
<p>On dry land, water flows to the reduction of the relief, forming a natural streams (streams, rivers). Each river has its source - the place where it starts. Leaks can be an underground spring, swamp, lake, glacier. Then the river flows towards the reduction of the relief natural cavity, which is called the river valley. Part of the valley is occupied continuously by water flow, called the rivers. During intense rainfall or when snow melt, there is flooding, in which water is poured floodplain - coastal part of the river valley. Some rocks dissolving water, and insoluble species, such as sand, clay, water erodes. In this way all the time channel deepening. Wobbly earlier part of the river valley, which were once floodplains are converted to terraces and never filled with water. The final section of the river at the place of its confluence with the sea, lake, or another river called the river mouth. The rivers have their tributaries - other rivers are usually shorter. The main river with all its tributaries form a river system, and the territory from which the river gathers its waters, called the Basin. Pools neighboring rivers separated by watershed.</p>
<p>Rivers easily erode soft rocks. But if on the way to the river there are more solid rock mountain, which is not able to handle the river, the rapids are formed - performances of solid rock above the bottom of the river in the form of individual boulders and waterfalls - in the Wake of the cliff from which water falls almost vertically.</p>
<p>The process flow of surface and ground water in the river is called its power. The rivers are fed by underground and rain water, meltwater ice and snow. Most rivers have mixed feed, so the different seasons of water in the river is changing. Changes in the river throughout the year called regime of the river. After prolonged rain, melting snow in the spring or summer melting of glaciers observed the highest water level in the river - flood. At a time when the river is fed only by groundwater, there is low water - lowest water level in the river.</p>
<p>Rivers is one of the most powerful external forces of nature. They have three types of work: demolition, transport and deposition of rocks. The destructive work of rivers called the river erosion. The eroded material carried by the river and deposited in its delta - plain at the mouth of the river, created by river sediment.</p>
<p>Less than 2% of the land occupied by lakes - natural basin filled with water. Originally lake lake basins are divided into several types. Tectonic lakes formed by subsidence of the crust in zones of faults; ice - vyorani ancient glaciers; residual - the remains of ancient sea basins; volcanic lake formed in the craters of volcanoes; karst emerged on soluble rocks; estuary - a section of the sea, secluded sand spits; zahatni - formed after landslides in the mountains; oxbow lakes are the remnants of river channels. With the water regime of the lake is divided into waste, which comes out at least one river, and stagnant - of which river does not flow through that they accumulate salts and they are mostly salt.</p>
<p>For their needs man has created many artificial ponds, blocking rivers large and small dams and paving shipping and irrigation canals.</p>
<p>Excessively wet areas with hydrophilic vegetation, which have a layer of peat over 30 cm, called bogs. Originally distinguish lowland, upland and transitional bogs. Fens are located in the humble parts relief and fed both by rain and river and groundwater. Upland swamps are formed at higher parts of the earth's surface, so only feed on precipitation.</p>
<p>As a result of the penetration of atmospheric moisture in the Earth's crust formed by groundwater. Rocks differently passed through a water. Sand and gravel, for example, water is passed well. Clay, tight sandstones, frozen ground is waterproof because the water kept. Above the layer of impermeable rock water accumulates, forming the aquifer. Closest to the surface of the lenticular temporary accumulation of water called the vadose and the first surface of the aquifer is not blocked waterproof layer - groundwater. Between the water-impermeable layers deposited mizhplastovi water.</p>
<p>One tenth of the surface area of ​​land occupied by glaciers. Most of the ice is concentrated in glaciers covering Antarctica and Greenland, where ice forms bahatokilometrova thickness. These glaciers are moving slowly due to the plasticity of ice and sliding into the ocean, split into huge pieces, forming icebergs.</p>
<p>Mountain glaciers are less powerful and moving at a slower speed. Going down from the mountains, the glacier slowly melts, nourishing rivers and lakes.</p>
