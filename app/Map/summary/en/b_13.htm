<p>Employment in certain sectors of the economy is determined as a percentage of the economically active population (employees), represented by the share of the working population is directly employed in social production. In most industrialized countries, the working population belongs to citizens over 15 years. In developing countries, this limit begins from 12-14 years, and in some African countries - even from the age of six.</p>
<p>Employment structure reflects the structure of the economy and the level of socio-economic development. The main trend in the employment structure in the world is an increase in employment in service sectors by reducing the share of employment in material production. Instead of agrarian and industrial eras coming post-industrial, which is characterized by the steady increase in the role of non-production sphere and turning it into a major global economy.</p>
<p>In developed countries the share of the population employed in the industrial sectors of the economy, ranging from 35 to 40% and the share of workers in agriculture and related industries is steadily decreasing (5-20%). At the same time, the number of employed in non-production environments, particularly in trade and finance, banking and management activities is 50%, and the Group of Seven countries - 70%.</p>
<p>In most developing countries, the employment structure significantly exceeds the share of agriculture represented less than the service sector, the smallest - industrial sector. This is due to the agricultural nature of the economy and low labor productivity in agriculture, growing mainly extensive way; and the proliferation of small trade.</p>
<p>In rich countries, oil exporters, affluent resort island countries and newly industrialized countries employment structure similar to the structure of employment in highly developed countries (70% of workers are employed in the service sector).</p>
<p>In post-socialist countries, the industry employs 40% in agriculture and related industries - up to 20% of employees. In the non-production sphere occupied about 30%, but unlike most developed countries are working in education, health care and culture. While as banking, trade and administrative spheres are in the making. Thus the structure of employment can be considered one of the key indicators of the level of development and use in its characteristics.</p>
