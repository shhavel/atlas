The main trend in the global structure of employment is to increase the number of people employed in service industries by reducing the share of employed in material production. In place of the agricultural and industrial age comes the post-industrial, which is characterized by a constant increase in the role of the non-productive sphere and its transformation into a major global economy.</p>
<p>In developed countries, the share of the population employed in the industrial sectors, ranging from 35 to 40%, while the number of employed in agriculture and neighboring areas constantly decreases (5-20%). At the same time, the number of employees in the non-manufacturing sector, particularly in the commercial and financial, banking and management reached 50%, and in the countries of the Group of Eight - 70%.</p>
<p>In most developing countries in the employment structure predominates the share of agriculture, less represented services, even less - the industrial sector. This is due to the nature of the agrarian economy and low labor productivity in agriculture, which develops mainly through extensive; and the predominance of small-scale trade.</p>
