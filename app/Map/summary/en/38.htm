<p>This card is in addition to the map, "Environmental problems". It can be used in characterizing the problem of environmental pollution, especially atmospheric pollution and greenhouse conditions. The essence of the greenhouse effect is that the atmosphere is almost completely transmits solar radiation on earth. Much the same portion of the reflected radiation from the Earth's surface (mainly the rays of the infrared spectrum) is delayed by atmospheric gases near the surface. This creates excessive heat, the most negative consequences of which are melting glaciers, rising sea levels and, as a consequence, the flooding of coastal areas.</p>
<p>The main pollutants of the atmosphere are the impurity gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFCs) released into the atmosphere due to the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, as well as mining, construction and other earthworks.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are called greenhouse gases, as getting into the atmosphere, they enhance the greenhouse effect, while creating the world the temperature at which there may be a biological life (approximately 15 ° C). Together with other gases make up the atmosphere they have existed for millions of years, provides the conditions for the survival of living organisms, and protect the earth from overheating and overcooling. Starting in the 50s. The twentieth century. atmospheric balance is disturbed by a sharp increase in revenues in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases. Their main source is road transport and thermal power stations.</p>
<p>Map shows that the highest CO2 emissions of industrial enterprises accounted for economically developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere. In China and India, the CO2 emissions are the result of burning large amounts of fossil fuels, and in Brazil, an additional source of CO2 are often fires in tropical forests. Methane is emitted to the atmosphere from the combustion of biomass, with rice fields and from cattle.</p>
<p>CFCs - gases of anthropogenic origin - are used in refrigerators, air conditioners, as solvents, sprays, detergents, etc. Increasing the content of CFCs in the atmosphere leads to the destruction of stratospheric ozone, ozone layer depletion, the emergence of the so-called ozone hole.</p>
<p>Changing the gas balance of the atmosphere is the cause of increasing the mean annual air temperature in the lower atmosphere at 0,5-1 ° C and, respectively, of global warming, increasing the length of the dry period in the northern hemisphere (recorded in the United States, Russia, China).</p>

<p>Illiteracy</p>
<p>The illiteracy rate in the country's population depends on many factors: historical traditions, mentality, education costs. On the economic development of the country accounts for up to 4% of the illiterate adult population, developing countries account for more than 9/10 of illiterate planet. In developing countries, a very large regional differences in this indicator. For example, in Africa, more than half the adult population are illiterate.</p>
<p>In East Asia - 1/4, while in Latin America, about 1/6. More than half of the world's illiterates falls on India and China - the country with the largest population.</p>
<p>In addition there is also a unit of illiteracy and functional illiteracy, ie the inability of man to orient and adapt to technological changes taking place in public life; understand the necessary explanations regarding employment; the inability to use the information network, etc. Functional illiteracy in the developed countries is one of the main reasons for the refusal of an employer.</p>
