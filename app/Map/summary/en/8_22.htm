<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p>Active participant in European politics of the second half of XVII - beginning of XVIII century. was Sweden. This Baltic country has reached at the time outstanding power: the Swedish king, seizing the Baltic States, held under the control of the Baltic Sea. This caused the opponents Sweden - Brandenburg, of Denmark, Poland, Muscovy - and could not help but tease those great powers such as England, Holland and France. However, Austria, France, England, Holland preparing for war of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714 gg.) And therefore could not actively intervene in the struggle for the Baltic states against Sweden.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the XVIII century. created favorable conditions for antyshvedskoyi coalition. Using this, the Danish king took Holstein, who was then an ally of Sweden, King of Poland and began a campaign against Livonia and besieged Riga. Preparing for war against Sweden and Tsar Peter I, who was immune from military operations in the north deterred war against Turkey. When in July 1700 Turkey signed the peace, Peter began to collect troops near the Swedish border. Moscow's war against Sweden began August 9, 1700, and entered into history under the name North.</p>
<p><b>PARTICIPATION OF UKRAINIAN Regiment in the Great Northern War</b></p>
<p>Interests Muscovy in the war against Sweden for obtaining exit through the Baltic Sea to Western Europe had nothing to do with the interests of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Cossacks were forced to defending the interests of Moscow, fighting on the territory of Muscovy, the Baltic states, the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>These trips were a heavy burden for the Cossacks. In fact, the first battle brought many losses.</p>
<p>In addition, the Cossacks for their service did not receive any remuneration, suffered from harassment and abuse Moscow commanders.</p>
<p>Ill-treatment by the command and causing severe conditions of service complaints and complaints, and sometimes even the Cossacks unauthorized return home.</p>
<p>To the discontent prompted that the Cossacks often used as cheap labor for the channel and excavations, construction of new roads, fortresses and other fortifications.</p>
<p>The real disaster was the Great Northern War and other segments of the Ukrainian population, because it is filled with his expense Cossack troops for annual trips to the north.</p>
<p>Apart from military turmoil, Cossacks worried tsarist government restrictions of their class rights.</p>
<p>Among Cossack sprang rumors of even more essential changes: elimination of Cossack self-imposition of governors and magistrates, relocation Cossack army to Muscovy and more.</p>
<p>The uncertainty of the future and forcing officers Hetman think about the destiny of the Hetmanate. Antymoskovskoho ridden sentiments, the officers put pressure on Mazepa, who, of course, and he understood the harmfulness of Ukraine's relations with Moscow.</p>
<p><b>Charles XII TRIP TO UKRAINE. FINDING A NEW ALLIES</b></p>
<p>Cherishing the dream Hetmanate output from the power of the king, Ivan Mazepa in the 1704-1705 biennium. Resorted to secret diplomacy with adversaries in Moscow. In particular, in the autumn of 1705 he established ties with the Polish king Stanislaw Leszczynski, who was elected in 1704 by the groups that supported the Swedish king.</p>
<p>Due to Leszczynski Ukrainian hetman was hoping to establish a relationship with Sweden.</p>
<p>In 1706 Mazepa really due to the mediation of the Polish king began secret relations with the Swedish King Charles XII.</p>
<p><b>External prerequisites antymoskovskoho uprising Ivan Mazepa</b></p>
<p>The victory of the king and the Polish king Augustus => Ukraine would be divided between Poland and Russia.
<p>The victory of Karl XII and his puppet Stanislas Leszczynski => Ukraine as an ally of Moscow, was used under Polish rule and would lose autonomy.
<p>The only salvation was deliverance from the power of the king, besides advance before the war and a peace treaty.</p>
<p><b>Hike Charles XII in Ukraine</b></p>
<p>Year 1708 Charles XII began to implement its long-standing plan to march on Muscovy.</p>
<p>The campaign was to take place in the direction of Smolensk and Moscow through the territory of Lithuania and Belarus. At the beginning of the campaign consisted successfully.</p>
<p>But after several failures in August - September, Charles XII refused the previous plan.</p>
<p>He decided to return to Ukraine, hoping to provide is your army with food, to strengthen its power Cossack regiments and troops Leszczynski.</p>
<p>The Swedish king also pinned hopes on help from the Crimean Khan and the Sultan of Turkey.</p>
<p>Change of plans of Karl XII was unexpected Mazepa.</p>
<p>This development Hetman considered premature, as being the Swedish army in the Ukraine meant that here unfold military operations of the Russo-Swedish War.</p>
<p>Given the task of liberation of Ukraine from the authority of the king became more difficult.</p>
<p>The big danger is also concealed the fact that the plans Mazepa was kept secret only the most loyal Cossack leaders, and ordinary Cossacks, knowing nothing about the designs of the hetman, preparing for war against the Swedes.</p>
<p><b>UKRAINIAN-Swedish Alliance</b></p>
<p>Hike the Swedish king to Moscow via Ukraine urged Ukrainian hetman decisive action to liberation Hetman.</p>
<p>Mazepa decided to team up with the Swedes for war against Muscovy.</p>
<p>October 24, 1708 Ivan Mazepa went to a meeting with Charles XII. With him went chotyrytysyachne army general officers and 7 of 12 colonels.</p>
<p>Evening, October 28 hetman came to the Swedish camp. The next day a meeting of Mazepa with Charles XII.</p>
<p>29-30 October 1708 between the Ukrainian and Charles XII, signed the agreement.</p>
<p>Brief (with 6 points) a statement that the contract contains "Output rights of Ukraine" - a political document that in 1712 Philip Orlik (general secretary for governance Mazepa, Hetman in exile), defending the rights of Ukraine, appealed to European monarchs.</p>

<li>Mazeppa should be a lifelong Duke Ukraine;</li>
<li>Swedish king has no right to claim the title of prince or commander of the armed forces of the principality;</li>
<li>for the strategic needs of the Swedish army could take five Ukrainian cities (Starodub Mglin, Baturin, Poltava, Gadyach).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACTIONS AGAINST UKRAINE Muscovite tsar</b></p>
<p>In response to the actions of Mazepa Peter appealed to Ukrainian. Numerous appeals Mazepa he accused of "treason", the intention to give Ukraine Poland and Orthodox churches and monasteries - Uniates.</p>
<p>King also ordered the officers and colonels meet urgently at the Deaf to elect a new Hetman. Meanwhile, Peter and Menshikov ordered to destroy the hetman's residence - Baturin.</p>
<p><b>Destruction Baturin</b></p>
<p>Having a royal decree, Moscow's troops marched on the capital Hetman.</p>
<p>In Baturin were significant military force was a lot of food and ammunition. The city defended the strong fortifications.</p>
<p>Therefore, attempts to quickly gain Baturin were unsuccessful: the inhabitants have been set up to protect the hetman capital.</p>
<p>And by the treachery of one of the regimental officers of the regiment Good Friday John Nosa, who pointed out a secret passage, Moscow November 2 soldiers entered the city and made it the massacre - brutally killed all its inhabitants, even the women and babies. Baturin was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Destruction Baturin and its inhabitants were not only revenge. This punitive act of trying to intimidate Peter Ukrainian and ultimately subdue them, depriving the desire for freedom.</p>
<p><b>Elected hetman Ivan Skoropadskiy</b></p>
<p>In another order of the king on November 6 at the deaf held officers' advice.</p>
<p>However, they came only four colonels: Starodubsky, Chernihiv, Pereyaslav and acting Nijinsky.</p>
<p>Hetman was elected Starodubsky Colonel John Skoropadskyi.</p>
<p>The election was preceded by a ceremony Hetman "punishment" Ivan Mazepa. It sort of dragged streets Glukhova a specially constructed scaffold.</p>
<p>Before "executed" dummy, was read a list hetmanovyh "sins" and pronounced sentence. November 12 in the presence of the king in Hlukhivsky Holy Trinity Church was proclaimed church curse (anathema) Mazepa.</p>
<p>Correspondence execution ceremony and proclamation was anathema to certify that action against the will of the king - the offense against God. Acts of Peter and by the brutal display of Moscow's colonial policy towards Ukraine. The main objective of the action - to sow guilt and fear in the general population Hetman, split the Ukrainian people, to eradicate from his mind the idea of ​​national identity and the desire for independence. After Baturin events, any attempt to National Liberation brutally suppressed and branded as mazepynstvo.</p>
<p><b>CONNECTING Cossacks to Swedish UKRAINIAN UNION</b></p>
<p>To somehow improve the situation, Ivan Mazepa sought to win over the Sich, who had not yet stuck to either party.</p>
<p>Zaporozhian 10,000th little army of fierce warriors glory, enjoyed the confidence and respect of the people and could be the force that would help the Swedes get out of poverty.</p>
<p>This is well understood and Peter, who during the winter 1708 - spring 1709 strongly urged not to support the Cossacks Mazepa.</p>
<p>Urinary Council decided to support Mazepa and go over to the Swedish king.</p>
<p>March 26 8000th detachment of Cossacks, breaking expensive units Muscovite army, came to Dykanka near Poltava. In Dikan'ka Cossacks welcomed Ivan Mazepa.</p>
<p>From there, the hetman with ataman Kostya Gordienko went to Great Budyscha to meet with Charles XII.</p>
<p>Meeting Mazepa Gordienko and Swedish king took place March 27, 1709.</p>
<p><b>Destruction Chortomlyk Host</b></p>
<p>The response of Peter to join the Cossacks Mazepa and Charles was the destruction of the Sich.</p>
<p>Heading in January, the troops of Colonel Yakovlev Moscow Cossack destroyed towns and villages. It devastated the town and Perevolochna where Vorskla merges with the Dnieper.</p>
<p>Cossack garrisons stationed there, Moscow's soldiers massacred and fleet Cossack boats burned.</p>
<p>However, to seize and destroy the first attempt in January Muscovites could not, after suffering considerable losses. To help Yakovlev came a detachment of Colonel Convivial Gnat Galagan. He knew in January and its surroundings and falsely promised Sich immunity. It also settled the matter.</p>
<p>May 14, 1709 was captured in January. Doing a royal order, the Moscow colonel executed all the prisoners, and destroyed Urinary fortress burned huts and military buildings. Guns, treasure and flags were removed.</p>
<p>Destruction of the Sich and massacre of Cossacks as burning Baturina, had the same goal - to put Ukrainian on his knees.</p>
<p><b>Battle of Poltava in 1709</b></p>
<p>In the spring of 1709 Charles XII resumed hostilities. He decided to launch attack on Moscow. The way Swedes had prolyahty through Kharkov and Kursk.</p>
<p>To move forward as planned operation, the Swedish army had to neutralize the well-fortified city of Poltava.</p>
<p>Swedish army came to Poltava in late April. Charles XII had hoped to take the city by storm and as a result of negotiations, however, that did not happen. So May 1 Swedish army was forced to begin the siege.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city came to Peter with the main forces.</p>
<p>June 27 there was a decisive battle. It started at 5 am, the Swedish infantry attack on Moscow redoubts (earthworks). About 11 o'clock the battle ended in complete defeat of the Swedes.</p>
<p>Battle of Poltava changed the political map of Europe. The victory of Peter I of Russia nominated for one of the leading contemporary European politics. Power of Sweden and Poland were actually blown forever.</p>
<p>For Ukraine, the consequences of the Battle of Poltava were extremely harsh: the Russian government, which won, was on the way to further limit the autonomy of the Hetmanate.</p>
<p><b>The reasons for the defeat of the Swedish-Ukrainian troops</b></p>
<p>Among the reasons for the defeat of the Swedish army historians call the first significant quantitative disparity of forces at Poltava.</p>
<p>Moscow with Ukrainian army regiments and Skoropadskiy Slobozhanshchina had about 50 thousand. Soldiers and 102 guns, the army of Karl XII is counted only 31 thousand. Only 6 soldiers and guns.</p>
<p>Ukrainian regiments Mazepa's direct involvement in the battle did not they guarded the Swedish army against the possible circumvention of the Muscovite army.</p>
<p>The defeat led to the fact that the forces of Charles XII zlehkovazhyv Russian army. The young commander too believed in his military happy.</p>
<p>He did not consider that the Swedish army was cut off from supply bases and that through the actions of the king became impossible assistance from the Khan.</p>
<p>In addition, the King of Sweden as a result of the injury could not personally control the battle.</p>
<p><b>Surrender Swedish troops</b></p>
<p>Escaped Swedish troops and Cossacks retreated to the banks of the Vorskla Perevolochna Cossack fortress, hoping to use for crossing the Dnieper Cossack flotilla, which is located there.</p>
<p>But after the attack on the flotilla Yakovlev troops left several boats. They were used for the crossing to the right bank of Karl XII and several generals and 3000th detachment, and Mazepa, Kostya Gordienko and several hundred Cossacks.</p>
<p>June 30 at Perevolochna Menshikov was a 10000th unit.</p>
<p>He forced the surrender of the rest of the Swedish army, numbering over 13 thousand. Cossacks in terms of surrender at all does not matter because Menshikov did not consider them on equal opponents.</p>
<p><b>The retreat of the Swedish king and Ukrainian Hetman</b></p>
<p>Charles XII and Mazepa went to the Turkish border. July 7th they crossed to the right bank of the Bug River, crossed the Turkish border near Ochakov and moved to Bandar.</p>
<p>August 1 wounded Charles XII and Mazepa patient stayed in the suburbs of Bandar. Here in the pan, Ivan Mazepa did not get up from bed, dozhyvayuchy last days. He died during the night to 22 September.</p>
<p>Hetman was buried in the pan; In March 1710 his coffin was taken to the Orthodox lands of Moldavia - m. Galati (now Romania) and there were reburied in the main church of the monastery of St. George.</p>
