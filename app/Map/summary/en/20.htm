<p><b>The concept of the horizon. Targeting areas</b></p>
<p>There are four major parties horizon: north, south, west, east. Between the main parties are intermediate, northwest, southwest, southeast, northeast.</p>
<p>Target areas - means able to determine the side of the horizon.</p>
<p>The most ancient way - is the orientation of the sun. If at noon to turn his face to the shadows, then we will be north behind - south. Right-east, and the left - west.</p>
<p>Guided by the clock and the sun. You must send the hour hand at the sun, and the angle formed between the direction of clockwise and figure 1 (13 hours) dial, divide the imaginary line down the middle. The line that divides this angle, indicate direction: front - south back - midnight.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that 13 hours should be divided left corner, and in the afternoon - right angle.</p>
<p>Guided by the North Star. Polaris is always at midnight. To find the North Star, we must first find the Big Dipper, which resembles a ladle, made up of seven fairly bright stars. Then, after two extreme right the stars of the Big Dipper to hold an imaginary line on which to postpone five times the distance between the outermost stars, and in the end that line we find the North Star, which, in turn, is at the tail of the constellation of other small ones Dipper.</p>
<p>Becoming a face to the North Star, we get the direction to the north.</p>
<p>Compass - a special device to determine the horizon. Marked on the dial side of the main horizon. Blue swiveling end of the needle points to the north, indicated - North. Red indicates the south, indicated - South.</p>
<p>Guided by spring snowmelt. South side of things heated up more than the north, respectively, and the melting snow on this side is faster. This is clearly seen in early spring thaws during the winter on the slopes of ravines, holes near the trees.</p>
<p>Guided by anthill, moss and lichen, birch bark. Trunks of trees in the forest, large rocks and boulders on the north side are covered with moss and lichens. A bark of white birch on the south side is always whiter compared to the north side. Birch is very sensitive to wind, so the slope of the trunk will also help navigate the forest. They help navigate the forest and its inhabitants. Anthill located on the south side of any tree or stump. Moreover, the south side of a steep north - steeper.</p>
