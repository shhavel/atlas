<p>Social and political life of Ukrainian lands in the late nineteenth - early twentieth century.</p>
<p>1. Communities movement in the Dnieper Ukraine 60-90 years. XIX centuries.</p>
<p>In the late 50-ies of the XIX century. in the liberalization of the Tsarist regime is a revival of the Ukrainian national movement. One of the Renaissance Center became the capital of the Russian Empire Petersburg. It was just a lot of Ukrainian and here, after serving sentences, allowed to return and even occupy high positions ex Bratchikov: Kostomarov Belozersky, Shevchenko.</p>
<p>In an effort to serve as many as possible to his people, the Ukrainian leaders Petersburg in 1859 created the first Ukrainian community - cultural and educational organization aimed at popularization of the national idea through publication of books, magazines, holding concerts, teaching in Sunday schools. Actually, the first community called difficult, rather it was an informal gathering leaders of the Ukrainian movement. However, it has become a role model.</p>
<p>In order to disseminate their views of St. Petersburg community for initiator Belozersky began publishing the magazine "Basis" (1861-1862). In the 60 years it was the only Ukrainian periodical highlighting all the nationwide problem - in culture, economics, politics, education, science, literature, folklore, history, mizhnaodnyh relations. Journal demonstrated that the existence of the Ukrainian nation, culture was a fact.</p>
<p>Ukrainian national movement vidrozhduvavsya, captured not only Ukrainian, and even some young Polish noble families spolschenyh or Right-bank Ukraine. The conscience of these people tormented by the realization that their grandparents, great-grandparents for centuries oppressed Ukrainian peasants, and that is why they need to get close and prysluzhyty people. This group, led by Vladimir Antonovich called hlopomaniv (derived from the word "slave" - ​​the name of the Polish gentry offensive to Ukrainian peasants), though they called themselves ukrainfil. They went to the Catholic faith of the Orthodox difficulty Ukrainian national dress, sang Ukrainian songs, deliberately kept the folk customs and avoided peasant society. In the beginning hlopomany during student holidays and other free time traveling the villages collecting folk tales, proverb, customs and rituals. Then they arranged meetings, prepared and read papers, produced a handwritten journal and established in 1859 a clandestine school, where he picked up a poor young man who "taught in the national direction." At the turn of 1860-1861 years. Hlopomaniv samorozpustyvsya group and its members, along with teachers and students of the Kyiv uniersytetu, among them P. Chubynsky, Drahomanov, utvoyly new company "Ukrainian community" which in 1862 numbered 200 members.</p>
<p>Kyiv community, as well as communities that have emerged in different cities of Ukraine (Chernigov, Vinnitsa, LOTS, Odessa, Poltava, Kharkiv) and Kuban (Ekaterinodar) and Moscow, its main purpose as an organization of public education in their mother tongue (founding schools, writing and publishing them textbooks, teacher training, etc.); scientific research in the field of ethnography, linguistics, history, preparation and publication of popular books and more. In short, engaged in cultural diyalnistyudiyalnistyu.</p>
<p>The revival of the Ukrainian movement at first caused no concern of imperial power and the Russian public. But preparation and blast the Polish uprising of 1863-1864., Fears that by Ukrainian cultural revival activities require the old human, and even independence, led to the publication of the Minister of Interior Valuev July 20, 1863 teyemnoho circular, went down in history as Valuev Circular. This document forbade public use of the Ukrainian language in public institutions, schools, churches, popular print, rylihiynoyi literature, in addition to works of art. Problem Ukrainian language roz'yazuvalasya famous phrase: "There is no separate Little Russian language was not, and can not be."</p>
<p>Unable to withstand persecution by the tsarist authorities, communities one after another samolikvidovuvalysya or were officially banned.</p>
<p>However, leaders are committed to the revival of Ukraine not left work. The main activity are focused on achieving success in the field of science or education field. However, the lack of organization made it impossible to develop the Ukrainian movement. Only in the late 60's, after the weakening of anti-Ukrainian policy communities appear again, but on irregular basis. And hiding gave little space for cultural activities and therefore leaders of the Ukrainian movement all the time trying to find legal forms for their work. This possibility has opened the establishment in 1873 of the Southwestern Branch of the Russian Geographical Society (PZVRHT), which is due Gromadovtsi center of Ukrainian studies. Also Kyiv community took their hands editing Russian newspaper "Kiev Telegraph".</p>
<p>Inauguration of the Department took place February 13, 1873</p>
<p>Chairman of the department elected Gregory P. Galagan higher education dignitary from landlords and popular Left Bank Kiev philanthropist, a man who cheered on the education of national intelligence. The Manager of cases was unanimously elected P.Chubynsky. Authority Division became "Notes South-West YRHO the department." An informal body of the Department was also newspaper "Kiev Telegraph," which appeared in the 1874-1876 biennium. Its editorial committee members Drahomanov, M. Sieber, F. Wolf, PA Chubynsky, Lysenko, P. Zhytetsky. The newspaper became an ardent advocate and defender of a large and fruitful work on the spiritual and material cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people, which launched the Kyiv community leaders under the auspices PZVRHT. The newspaper missed an opportunity to stigmatize a particular anti Russian speech reaction media.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the Department were involved considerable scientific potential. Only full members recruit up 76 of them - Mr. Antonovich, MI, VR and Lysenko, O. Ushinskiy (brother of the famous teacher) and many others. In them selflessly worked for the Department of a large cohort of staff and provincial reporters that sent by the records of people's way of life, traditions and beliefs.</p>
<p>In publishing department has conducted a variety of activities. One of the first was held in 1874 odnodnevnoho Census Kyiv. As a result of the census, which was, moreover, and the first in the city, it appears that in it, more than half are officially considered (total number exceeded 220 thousand. Pers.). There was also z`yasovanyy ethnic composition of the city: Ukrainian constituted the largest ethnic group.</p>
<p>Another important event of the Department, which gained international publicity, was held in August 1874 III Archaeological Congress, which indicated a high level of archaeological research on Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>Not breaking any laws and circulars, using only the Russian language, humanities scholars have established research center with Ukrainian scientific and wide movement involving researchers and enthusiasts provincials, collectors of all sorts of materials and contributors to major magazines. In Ukraine, an embryo formed National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>The growth of the authority of this cultural movement Under the Department (1873-1876) it had made considerable research activity published 7 volumes of "Working South-West expedition" (1,200 pages each, not including attachments), two volumes of "Memoirs of South-West otdelah Y.R.H.O. "also prepared material on the three volumes of the works of M. Maximovich; established ethnographic museum, library and archive.</p>
<p>But at this time for scientific work closely hromadamen eye tsarist police rozhlyadilo threat to the future of Ukrainian separatism (department). Most efforts to slander on Ukrainian leaders made M.Yuzyfovych, Poltava landowner, a former member of the Kyiv community, one of the organizers PZVRHT but loyal servant of the Empire.</p>
<p>The result of denunciations and slanders of the Ukrainian movement was signing king May 18, 1876 Ems decree. He dramatically increased the repression against Ukrainian culture and imposed a new ban on the Ukrainian language. It is prohibited, importation from abroad of books in Ukrainian; printing and publishing in Ukrainian original works, translations, the play for theater performances, texts to music, in addition to historical monuments. The decree abolished PZVRHT prohibited community has established strict control over literary works into Ukrainian, who had published the Russian spelling. Prohibited activities theater company with purely Ukrainian repertoire. A separate paragraph of the decree dealt personally Dragomanova Chubinskogo were forbidden to live in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ems decree was a serious blow to the Ukrainian science, culture and the Ukrainian movement as a whole. Decree remained in force until 1905, however, this time the communities' movement was not stopped. The communities that survived continued to exist underground, seeking new ways to restore legal activities. As in previous years, the strongest and most influential was Kiev (Old) community.</p>
<p>Within the Russian Empire organize legal work was impossible and therefore Gromadovtsi agree on the organization of Ukrainian national center abroad, who had set up publishing uncensored Ukrainian press and represent Ukrainian movement in Europe. Perform this task congregation commissioned Michael Dragomanova. Also, his fate had a role to develop a political program of the Ukrainian movement that is put before him a clear goal and outline ways to achieve it, as it became clear that without changes in the social system of the Russian Empire for the better for the Ukrainian will not.</p>
<p>Leaving abroad Drahomanov started a close relationship with leaders of Ukrainian Galicia, with Pavlyuk and S. Podolynsky began publishing the magazine "Community" (1878 - 1879 gg., 1882). The basis of the proposed program Drahomanov lay these principles. as a democracy (providing citizens with democratic rights and freedoms and the organization of power to democratic principles); Federalism (providing Ukrainian composed of autonomous rights and implementation of public authorities); kulturnytstvo (liberation struggle must be conducted exclusively educational forms and methods); evolutionary (to avoid radical changes and prefer a gradual development); Europeanism (oriyentaiya Ukraine in its development in Europe).</p>
<p>Launched Drahomanov program for existing conditions that prevail in Russia after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, was too radical. Therefore Kyyivka community severed relations with Drahomanov and stopped funding the magazine. She refused on political activities that could provoke reprisals from the Russian government. The only evidence of the Ukrainian movement in the Russian Empire was a Russian-language edition of "Kievan antiquity" (1882 - 1907 gg.), Who continued ukrainovedcheskie study.</p>
<p>Such painstaking research work had attracted young people wanted action, and vigorous political activity that would be aimed at the overthrow of the existing order and establish a new more equitable. Youth hurtuvalas around the Russian and Polish movements that fought against the autocracy revolutionary methods, but this did not satisfy its national aspirations and did not work Ukrainian people. Finally, nationally conscious youth has become orhanizovuvty community, called "youth" or "student". A lot of them faced in the 90 years of the nineteenth century. The most radical of the student groups were tarasivtsi Brotherhood (1891 - 1898 gg.).</p>
<p>The older generation hromadamen also concluded that without the daily political activities all ix previous cultural work will disappear. Make it legally within the Russian empire was almost impossible, soothes Ukrainian leaders decided to lay the foundation for Ukrainian political movement in Galicia, where the conditions for political activity were more favorable. At the same time, the bank Ukraine they decided to unite their forces for a more productive work on the cultural field. In 1898 Kiev was established the nationwide non-party organization (tools), which served as the coordinator of the community. So the community has grown from some groups to zahalnokrayinskoyi organization begun preparing the ground for political struggle. They ensured the connection of the Ukrainian movement - the Left Bank and Right Bank. Supplied nastupist generations of the Ukrainian movement. Hromadamen their fruitful research on the history, ethnography, folklore, statistics, linguistics showed that Ukrainians have hlybke historical roots, distinct ethnic identity, defined ethnic boundaries. They brought the Ukrainian movement to realize the need to formulate and develop political action program.</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth century. the Ukrainian movement among young intellectuals occurs nationalist movements. It arose as a reaction to the crisis cultural movement (Ukrainophyls). Clearly, the root causes was the colonial status of the Ukrainian people in the Russian Empire.</p>
<p>In the early 90's. The nineteenth century. Kyiv formed student group, which included MI Mikhnovskyy, SM Shelest, AP Kuczynski et al. This group had close relations with leading figures of the Ukrainian movement. From this group came leaders who soon founded a secret "Brotherhood tarasivtsi." Back in 1891 the census of movable property in the Poltava province known Ukrainophile OO Russov, attracted to the work of many students. It was during this work formed a circle of four students (J. Linden, M. Bayzdrenko, M. Bazkevych, V. Borovik). In the summer of 1891 they folded oath of allegiance to the idea of ​​liberation of Ukraine on the grave of Taras Shevchenko, founded a secret society whose members were later called themselves "The Brotherhood tarasivtsi."</p>
<p>The first public performance of "Brotherhood" was reading speech on Shevchenko anniversary in March 1893 at Kharkiv University. That same year, the speech was published in the Journal of the Galician "True" entitled "Profession de foi young Ukrainian." The ideas expressed in speech, can hardly be described as a nationalist (independence), but against apolitical kulturnytstva and the general decline of Ukrainian political movement they were truly national radicalism. In a speech stated:</p>
<p>- There is a separate Ukrainian nation;</p>
<p>- As each nation, Ukrainian national will need to "work and progress";</p>
<p>- Full autonomy of Ukraine (at the time this slogan is not vidvazhuvavsya none);</p>
<p>- The unity of the Ukrainian people (this slogan was the embryo of the future concept of collegiality Ukrainian state);</p>
<p>- Negative Ukrainophyls (kulturnytstva), but recognized its benefits to the national movement;</p>
<p>- The radicalism and extremism on the "apostates";</p>
<p>- The need for Ukrainian schools;</p>
<p>- Use of the Ukrainian language and so on.</p>
<p>The ideas of "Brotherhood" found its supporters, but have not found widespread because of its sharply negative attitude to other movements Ukrainian movement and and due to the personal qualities of leadership "tarasivtsi" MI Mihnovskiy.</p>
<p>"Tarasivtsi Brotherhood" was founded on the principles of the secret organization and broke into "five", which in mid-90s operating in Kharkiv, Odessa, Yekaterynoslav, Poltava, Chernihiv and some other cities.</p>
<p>Members of the Brotherhood conducted mainly organizational and educational work aimed at shaping national identity.</p>
<p>In 1893 in Kiev the organizational gathering, which probably had to give the organization a more coherent form. But since "Brotherhood tarasivtsi" had no concrete program of action, and sometimes simply duplicate old kulturnytstvo in original extreme forms (eg, demonstrative wearing traditional dress), it was declining. In the late 90s it actually collapsed. This was due to police harassment of members.</p>
<p>2. The emergence of Ukrainian political parties in Dnieper Ukraine in late XIX - early XX century.</p>
<p>End of XIX - beginning of XX century. characterized by new developments in social and political life of Ukrainian lands. The beginning of the "rebirth of the nation" called this time the famous Ukrainian writer and social activist VK Vynnycenko.</p>
<p>Ukrainian national movement gaining political nature. In Ukraine, begin to form the first national political party.</p>
<p>The first national party in Dnieper Ukraine (ie, the central, southern and eastern states of Ukraine) was the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party (RUP), founded January 29, 1900 in Kharkiv figures student communities D. Antonovich, M. Rusovykh, G. Andriewsky, LA Matsievich et al. Political programs in PA, 1900-1903. M. brochure was Mikhnovsky "Independent Ukraine". M. Mihnovskiy, at one time a member of the "Brotherhood tarasivtsi" active member of the Ukrainian liberation movement, a lawyer by profession, was one of the ideological inspirers of MSA at the beginning of its existence. This outstanding politician Ukraine Naddnepryanschine first raised the slogan of national independence. The main purpose of the establishment he believed at any price independent Ukraine "from the Carpathians to the Caucasus." The basis of the Ukrainian nation RUP considered peasantry. Since 1903 rupivtsi moved to Western principles of Erfurt Programme of the Social Democrats, called for national-cultural autonomy within Russia.</p>
<p>1902 MSA departed from the most radical wing of his party and formed - Ukrainian People's Party (NUP), led by Mihnovskiy. The party was overtly nationalistic. The main policy document "10 Commandments" proclaimed the establishment of an independent democratic republic slogan "Ukraine for the Ukrainian." 1903 from PA came another group, headed by B. Yaroshevskim. It naymenuvalo themselves Ukrainian Socialist Party (USP). As NFA and USP were few and not having any mass support in the community, soon collapsed.</p>
<p>In late 1904 - early 1905 after a split in the new PA formed a new political organization - Ukrainian Social Democratic Union (abbreviated "Union"), headed by M. Melenevskyi students, Basque and A. cursive-Yoltuhovskym. The Union was quite numerous at that time (about 6 thousand. Members). She called proletarians towns and villages deploy strike movement. Armed insurrection as a form of revolutionary struggle, she did not approve. Proposed to solve the land issue in a democratic way: Resolution convened specifically for this people's Constitutional Council. In 1905 Union joined the Menshevik faction of the RSDLP on the rights of autonomous sections.</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century. Ukrainian formed liberal parties. Thus, in 1904 formed the Ukrainian Democratic Party (UDP) led by moderate public figures O. Lototsky, Chykalenko et al. Later on she broke Ukrainian Radical Party (SRP), led by writers B.Grinchenko and S. Efremov. Both parties - nechyselni composition. In its basic programming terms were close to the Russian "Union of Liberation" (future embryo Cadet Party) advocated the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, the Russian Empire, which would be granted Ukraine the right to autonomy (about radical social change does not matter). The next year PSA and UDP merged into Ukrainian democratic Radical Party (UDRP).</p>
<p>In 1905 there was a reorganization and balances MSA, which then took the name - Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party (USDRP). Its leaders - D. Antonovich, V. Vynnycenko, Petliura, M. Porsche.</p>
<p>USDRP and the Union failed to develop a clear tactic of its activities and cooperation with other parties and NGOs. 1909 Union collapsed. Managers are USDRP Petliura and B. Sadowski began searching for allies in novoorhanizovanomu 1908 inter-party political bloc Ukrainian liberal activists (mostly of former members of the UDRP, which was self) - Association of Ukrainian progressives (TUP). Leaders TUP - M.Grushevskiy, S. Wilkens, D.Doroshenko advocated constitutional and parliamentary path of struggle for "Ukrainian business."</p>
<p>So, with the exception of NFA that his ideals proclaimed an independent Ukrainian state, the other national parties Dnieper Ukraine (RUP, USP, Union, USDRP, UDP, PSA, etc.) Have the basis for their application demands for political autonomy of Ukraine was part of Russia.</p>
<p>Among all- parties had their own committees in Dnieper Ukraine, it should be noted Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), which after 1903 split into Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin) and Menshevik leader whom was J. Tsederbaum (Martov); Socialist-Revolutionary Party (SRs), the Constitutional Democrats (Cadets), "Union of October 17" ("Octo"). There were also Polish Socialist Party and the Jewish "Bund" ("Union").</p>
<p>3. Populists, radicals Muscophiles in social and political life of Western Ukraine in the second half of the XIX century.</p>
<p>Suppression of the uprising in 1848 strengthened the power of the Habsburgs. At that time Galicia and Bukovina belonged to the Austrian Empire, Transcarpathia owned Hungary. These were some of the most backward parts of Europe. Western areas were actually internal colony. 1867 formed the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Strengthening the Hungarians, followed by the Poles deeply hurt Ukrainian. Representatives of the Ukrainian movement, thinking about his future, looking for reliable support in social and political life.</p>
<p>In their search for the western Ukrainian were not alone. Similar problems arose and to other oppressed Slavic nations - Czechs, Serbs, Bulgarians. They directed their attention to. Thus, at Western strengthened current supporters in Moscow - Muscophiles or as they are called Russophile. Flow especially strengthened in the late 60s of the XIX century. after spreading their influence on the majority of the clergy, which had a huge impact on public life. Russophilism Polish influence was a form of opposition, a means of self-affirmation Ukrainian spirituality.</p>
<p>Russophile Ukrainian belonged to the representatives of the Ukrainian movement that desperate in their own capabilities to achieve political or even cultural purposes. They saw the futility of attempts to raise the activity of the people, and trying to enlist the support of Russia, emphasized the identity of Ukrainian and Russians proximity of their crops. However, lack of knowledge of Russian, Ukrainian language neglect led to the extension of the Polish language. Although the prestige Russophile printed on obscure Church Slavonic language, they have had a significant impact on the Ukrainian edition, they belonged to the largest newspaper "Slovo", a number of Ukrainian schools. In 1870 they founded a political organization - n Council, which tried to turn into a single representative of Ukrainian Galicia.</p>
<p>Ukrainian youth gradually vtyahuvalas conflict with Russophiles, which include mostly wealthy religious and secular officials. First, differences appeared in the field of language and literature. Russophiles promoted the works of Russian writers Slavophiles. Young people from among the students, priests, secular intellectuals fond of the works of Taras Shevchenko, Panteleimon Kulish, Mykola Kostomarov. Those who are concerned about the life and fate of the Ukrainian nation, focusing on its problems called populists. The leading figures of the movement were Barvinskyi, V.Navrotskyy, J. Romanchuk, O.Ohonovskyy, A. Vahnyanyn.</p>
<p>For populists most acute issue that was the issue of language and literature. Their knowledge of typical Ukrainian nation from others. Unlike Russophile populists did not seek external support. They organized secret circles, published journals, developed by Ukrainian grammar and dictionaries, founded the theater, cultural and educational organization "Russian conversation." In 1868 there was a company "Enlightenment" that engaged in the study and education of the people.</p>
<p>Landmark event occurred in 1873 in Lviv. With the support of wealthy Lizaveta Skoropadskyi-Miloradovich and Basil Symyrenka here was created Literary Society. Shevchenko. Later it was called scientific society and turned into an unofficial Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>After a new wave of persecution of the Ukrainian culture in Dnieper Ukraine (Ems decree 1876) populists were closely communicating with the eastern Ukrainian who turned their attention to Western counterparts. Under their influence populists broke with Russophiles. In contrast to their "word" they started publishing the newspaper "Delo".</p>
<p>In the 70s of the XIX century. movement of radical populists separated flow. This was caused, particularly vigorous activity Dragomanov who encouraged young people to go on the older generation, not only words but deeds raise the Ukrainian society. Most capable followers Dragomanova views were John Franco and Michael Pavlik. They launched an offensive on the Russophile and later moved to the criticism and populists. This led to serious differences in Western social movement, in practice meaning the intellectual and ideological revolution.</p>
<p>Political life became more dynamic. 1885 populists established representative body - the People's Council. In the 90-ies of the XIX century. populists faced with four political parties.</p>
<p>4. The emergence of political parties in Western Ukraine in the late nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The end of the nineteenth century. was a turning point in the development of Ukrainian national movement. With the emergence of the first Ukrainian national idea of ​​parties beyond the intelligentsia environment and penetrates the masses. The historical arena comes a new, energetic generation of leaders, which raises demand complete independence of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The first Ukrainian political parties emerged in Galicia. In October 1890 in Lviv was founded Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party (RURP). Initiators of this party were Franko and M. Pavlik. For tips Dragomanova they were in the position of "scientific socialism." In 1895 the program included provisions that fully socialist ideas can be implemented as part of an independent Ukrainian state, but in the short term - within a fully autonomous province of the Austrian Empire. In addition to these provisions, the program put forward the requirements of transmission farmers as much land. Deklaruvalos establishing collective labor organization and collective ownership of the means of production in an evolutionary way. Party issued for farmers newspaper "farmers" and "Community". To promote program regulations were issued a series of pamphlets under the title "Radical tactics" (Franko). Great attention is paid party promoting their ideas in the peasant masses through various institutions and organizations. Despite the hard work, the party is not gained a wide support. Against it was set up clergy, which blocked access to the party of the peasantry. Socialist ideas were not supported by malochyselnist Ukrainian proletariat. At the end of 1899 the party crisis.</p>
<p>In 1899 there is a Ukrainian Social Democratic Party (USDP), founded by Nicholas perpetual, Wityk Simon, Julian Bachinsky. It was created to defend the interests of Ukrainian workers. The national question appeared advocate political independence of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In 1899 formed the Ukrainian National Democratic Party (UNDP), which has become the most widespread and influential party. The founders of the party were updated and some radical populists. The most prominent figures of the party were E. Levitsky, V. Okhrymovych, M.Grushevskiy and Franko. In your program, the UNDP announced its long-term objectives of the independence of Ukraine, its immediate goals, she attributed the preservation of autonomy and commitment to the Habsburgs. In other respects it was typical of the Liberal Party, which sought to avoid acute social problems. His moderation and people 'tactics she won the affection of most of the population. Under its influence was situated "Education" and other organizations and institutions.</p>
<p>Also in 1899 some members of the clergy formed the Ruthenian Catholic Union. But being clerical-conservative party, she did not find broad support even among priests.</p>
<p>With the growing organizational and political force in Galicia waning influence Russophile who handed over their positions as the organizational and political level. So "Enlightenment" in Galicia had 900 branches, similar Russophile organization - only 106. In the election in 1913 to the Galician Sejm was elected 30 Ukrainophiles and only 1 Russophile.</p>
<p>Hoping delaying its decline in 1900 proclaimed Russophile "New Deal", which called for the complete identification with Russia. They founded the Russian National Party, which received large grants from the imperial government and was supported by the Polish aristocracy, so to split the Ukrainian movement.</p>
<p>5. Populist movement in Ukraine</p>
<p>Populists - is an all different ranks of the intelligentsia movement that emerged under the influence of socialism and features of the second half of XIX century. They advocated the overthrow of the autocracy by peasant revolution. Appearing at the end of the 60-ies of the XIX century. The populist movement became a significant factor in social and political life in the mid 70's. Populists were convinced that the preservation of collectivist traditions of rural communities in the future lead to a socialist organization of society. Russia, they are interpreted, in contrast to Western Europe should avoid the capitalist stage of development and farmers Populists considered the driving force of the revolution in the way society to socialism.</p>
<p>In 1874 they launched a propaganda work among the peasants. However, not all members of "going to the people" immediately suffered repression from the government. Moreover, their propaganda was incomprehensible to the peasants. Then populists ripe idea to create undercover revolutionary organization. "Land and Freedom", which appeared in late 1876, led the fight for the transfer of land to the peasants, the elimination of redemption fees and taxes.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the most famous group of the organization created in the early 1875 V. Debohoriy-Mokriyevych. 1877 stood out from the circle group Ia Stefanovich, who created Chigirinskogo in villages and districts of Cherkasy underground peasant organization "Secret Wife" including more than 1000 participants. Gendarmes prevented the preparation of the rebellion crushed organization.</p>
<p>Having lost faith in the peasantry able to rise against autocracy, populists reviewed tactics and resorted to terror. Shot in V. Zasulich Trepova Governor-General in January 1878 spawned a wave of attacks on senior officials of the king's staff and directly to the king.</p>
<p>In August 1879, "Land and Freedom" split into separate organizations - "People's Will" and "Black Repartition". "People's Will" opened a new stage in the revolutionary movement, the stage of revolutionary terror. It has developed a military organization of a few hundred "officers." Similar groups exist in Odessa, Nikolaev, Kherson and other cities of Ukraine. Members of organizations was carried out by a series of terrorist attacks against senior officials and the king. Boom, "the People" death sentence Tsar Alexander II was completed March 1, 1881.</p>
<p>"Chornoperediltsi" remained on the platform of "Land and Freedom". The leadership of this organization were, in particular, P. Axelrod, L. Deutsch, V. Zasulich, Plekhanov, J. Stefanovic. Mugs "Black Repartition" acted in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities of Ukraine. Harassment by the police forced the founders of the "Black Repartition" emigrate. In the late 80's - early 90's populist movement yields a mass working-class and socialist movement. The purpose and methods of dealing Populists were wrong.</p>
