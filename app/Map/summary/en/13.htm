<p>Mineral resources - a combination of mineral reserves of mineral origin, which are already used or could be used in future human activities. In our time is used more than 200 kinds of minerals. Depending on the purpose of mineral resources are divided into three groups:</p>
<p>Fuel (energy) - are used to produce heat and light.</p>

<p>Metal (Ore) - of which melted metal (ferrous and non-ferrous metals).</p>
<p>Non-metallic (non-metallic) - used as a raw material for the chemical industry (muriate of potash, phosphates, sulfur), as construction and maintenance materials (asbestos, graphite, diamonds).</p>
<p>Mineral deposits are located in the world is very uneven. This is due to the peculiarities of the tectonic structure of the crust. For a better understanding of the laws governing the distribution of minerals on the tectonic map shows the area of ​​the continents (platforms and seismic belt).</p>
<p>Fuel and some non-metallic minerals of sedimentary origin formed as a result of many centuries of accumulation of sediment. The deposits of these minerals are most often found in the sedimentary cover of the ancient platforms and in the foredeep of the Old and ancient folded. In the relief of these tectonic structures correspond to the plains (see. The physical map of the world).</p>
<p>Mining and chemical nonmetallic minerals also advantageously have a sedimentary origin.</p>
<p>Metallic minerals are confined to the ancient Precambrian shields and platforms folded regions of the crust. That is why the rich ore minerals are confined to the old low mountains, highlands and plateaus.</p>
<p>Ferrous metals (iron, manganese) in the crust layers are deposited, forming a large area pools.</p>
<p>Ferrous metal ores occur in the bowels of the earth kind of belts. Thus, copper and polymetallic ores are common in folded regions of the Cordilleras - the Andes, tin ore - in the Pacific zone.</p>
<p>Availability of mineral resources is a good prerequisite of economic development of any country.</p>
