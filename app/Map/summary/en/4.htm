<p>The signing of peace treaties with Germany and its allies during the first World War, did not calm down the raging war and revolution Europe. Armed conflicts, revolutions, riots, political crisis continued to shake the continent of Europe have for several years.</p>
<p>The main root cause of acute political struggle and confrontation was in the development of Versailles, which was the first attempt in history to achieve a harmony of interests of individual states and the entire international community, but was unfair, particularly in relation to the defeated countries.</p>
<p>Also new European borders, carried on the map after prolonged diplomatic bargaining, do not always take into account the will of the peoples of the areas that were subject to the territorial redistribution. Particularly evident discrepancy of frontiers and boundaries reflects ethnic settlement map "The people of Central and Eastern Europe in the interwar period." In 1923, most interstate conflicts connected with the territorial issue was rozv`yazano, some postponed for the future. So, Italy lead Fiume solved the problem. I went to the armed conflict with Greece for the island of Corfu, but this time to no avail (1923). Poland, by any means, managed to achieve the accession of Silesia Vilna region, and by the Riga Peace 1921 . of the Soviet republics - Western Ukraine and Western Belarus. In 1923 the new eastern border of Poland was voted the Entente. remained unresolved dispute between the Soviet Republic and Romania regarding Bessarabia.</p>
<p>Instability of the situation added new attempts leaders of the Comintern and Soviet Russia to foment world revolution in Europe after the defeat of the socialist revolutions in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia in 1919 Thus, during the Soviet-Polish War of 1920-1921. The Red Army wanted to bring their bayonets revolution Europe. But better armed Polish army managed to stop the "red invasion." The next attempt took place in 1923, when Bulgaria, Poland and Germany were also organized armed intervention, led by the Communist Party. But these uprisings were brutally suppressed by government troops, the Communist Party was police harassment and lost for a long time a large number of their supporters.</p>
<p>War and post-war instability had a great influence on the political situation in Europe, even those who escaped the revolution. In England the situation was stabilized by broad social reforms. In France, the tension failed to translate into a state of waiting time when Germany to pay reparations. In Spain established authoritarian regime of Primo de Rivera (stimulated by the defeat of the Spanish army in the war with the Republic of IF in Morocco). The postwar turmoil in Italy, which was called "losers among the winners" have resulted in "red biennium" (1920-1921 gg.), When the workers took power in factories, driving owners. Italy fell into chaos, the government was in complete inactivity. In such circumstances, the ruling elite scared "red danger" appointed Prime Minister of Italy leader B. Mussolini fascist movement. October 30, 1922, he led troops entered the Blackshirts of Rome. Mussolini began to actively fascist country and transform Italy into a powerful Mediterranean empire.</p>
<p>In the early 20's in the leading countries of the Allied forces came to power who did not want to place the responsibility for the injustice of Versailles, at the same time trying to improve it. As a result, in the 20's. A series of measures to remedy the shortcomings of the postwar arrangement in Europe.</p>
<p>One of the weaknesses of the new system is the removal from it of. An attempt to isolate Russia through commitment of its leaders to the idea of ​​world revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat was not successful, but has made a destructive element in international relations. In the early 20's. It became clear that the Bolsheviks entrenched in power and plans for world revolution - not feasible. In 1922 the Russian delegation was invited to the Genoa conference on search of "economic recovery in Central and Eastern Europe," where, among other issues, an attempt was made to develop common conditions for normalization of relations with Soviet Russia and other Soviet republics. But problems paying debts royal party were unable to overcome. Entente countries billed at a rate of 18 billion rubles. In response to Soviet Russia demanded that she pay 39 billion rubles. for damages intervention of the Entente. In addition, a delegation of Soviet Russia flatly refused to pay the debts of the Provisional Government.</p>
<p>Appearing at a conference in critical condition, April 16, 1922, Soviet Russia and Germany in the town of Rapallo signed an agreement on the restoration of diplomatic relations in full and to waive any claims. This agreement started a long and fruitful cooperation between Russia and Germany in economic, political and military spheres. Under this treaty, Russia forgave Germany its debt -10,000,000,000 rubles. The agreement was a breakthrough on the diplomatic front that brought Russia and Germany from international isolation. Treaty of Rapallo created a fundamentally new situation in Europe. Two "offended" state entered into an agreement, effectively jeopardizing the winners is produced postwar security system. The one that saved the Versailles system was that Germany remained weak peace, and Russia - revolution and protracted civil war.</p>
<p>Since 1924 rolled a wave of diplomatic recognitions from other Western countries, who were concerned about the possibility of creating a strong Soviet-German antyversalskoho block. Exceptions were only the United States. However, the relationship between the West and the Soviet Union were unequal. The Soviet Union tried to remove from the solution of European Affairs, isolate it, to create a country that had a common border with it, "sanitary zone". This led to the distrust of the Soviet leadership in the West and contributed to an ever closer rapprochement with Germany and Turkey.</p>
<p>It was then accelerated solution of problems connected with the fulfillment of the Treaty of Versailles and Germany's return to the world community as a full member.</p>
<p>The most acute left the question of reparations. Established in 1921 amount (123 billion marks) was beyond the power of Germany. France also demanded full payment and to make Germany before, together with Belgium occupied the Ruhr region, where heavy industry was concentrated in Germany (1923).</p>
<p>An international crisis. In order to solve the difficult situation in London in 1924 convened an international conference, which was adopted a plan developed by the Commission of Experts led by American banker Dawes. According to the plan envisaged the withdrawal of French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr and Germany zobov`yazuvalasya in the next 4 years to pay 1-1,75 billion. Marks a year, and in subsequent years - 2 billion. During the 6 years of this plan, Germany has paid 7 5 billion marks. The plan was to provide Germany British and American loans in the amount of $ 2 billion. How to guarantee the plan is established allied control of the railways and the State Bank of Germany. The plan Dawes contributed to the restoration of the German economy, but put it in dependence on the US.</p>
<p>In 1929 a new plan was adopted by an American businessman and banker Jung, followed by reparations volume decreased to 113.9 billion marks, and annual payments were set at a rate of 2.5 billion marks. Payments are spread over 55 years. Under the plan, all kinds of control over Germany and its economy and finances canceled. To obtain reparations and their distribution was established Bank for International Settlements. The bank played a leading role in financing the leading sectors of the German economy and helped further pryv`yazuvannyu Germany's economy in the United States.</p>
