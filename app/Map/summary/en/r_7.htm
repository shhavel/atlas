<p>Climatic zones - a latitudinal bands, each of which has a relatively uniform climate that determined by the amount of solar radiation and prevailing air masses. There основнііперехіднікліматичні zones.</p>
<p>For major climatic zones (equatorial, tropical, temperate, Arctic and Antarctic) inherent supremacy during the year one of the zonal types of air masses. Transition zone (or subpoyasy) are characterized by seasonal dominance of different air masses coming from the neighboring main zones.</p>
<p>Depending on a combination of climatic parameters (average temperature, annual temperature amplitude, the number and mode of rainfall, prevailing winds) distinguish between types of climate. In addition, due to significant differences in climate marine and continental areas within the same climatic zone types are distinguished principal type of climate - climate region (arid and humid - tropical climate, Continental, Mediterranean, monsoon, with uniform moisture - subtropical, continental, temperate continental , maritime monsoon - temperate climate).</p>
<p>On the map are climatic zones and areas with the characteristics of the main conditions: solar radiation, prevailing air masses, seasonal temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>The climate is one of the main factors of settlement living organisms on the planet. The most populated favorable for the development of life equatorial and sub-equatorial zones. Territory is the extremely harsh climatic conditions of the least utilized by living organisms.</p>
