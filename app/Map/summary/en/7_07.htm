<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. Resettlement East Slavic tribal unions - Ukrainian ancestors</b></p>
<p>Concerning living tribes, Slavic tribes occasionally united in much larger Union - tribal association or union of tribes.</p>
<p>Existed for a bit, these alliances disintegrated, and instead eventually formed new ones. (Actually, the grand unification of the Slavic tribes were Veneti, and anti and sklavyny.)</p>
<p>According to the researchers, they were made up of smaller tribal alliances.</p>
<p>The names of East of tribal alliances that have survived to the time of formation of the state, retained chronicle "The Tale of Bygone Years".</p>
<p>For example, in Ukraine, according to historical records, lived seven tribal entities: glade, drevlyans, Volhynians, Croats, Ukichi, Tyvertsi and Northerners.</p>
<p>Please note that along with the name "Volynyane" still the chronicler takes two - Dulibs and Buzhans. Most modern scholars believe that all three names apply to one tribal alliance, while "Dulibs" - an ancient name, and the second two have arisen subsequently.</p>
<p><b>The territorial boundaries of the tribal lands of East Union on Ukraine.</b></p>
<p>Glade lived in the Middle Dnieper "in the forests on the mountains above the river Dnipro." Later they settled and on the left bank.</p>
<p>To the west of the field lived drevlyans. Their lands lying between the rivers Sluch and the Dnieper, Pripyat and Teterev.</p>
<p>Even further to the west, up to the Western Bug and Goryn lay the ground Dulebs (Buzhans, Volyn).</p>
<p>To the northeast of the field, the left tributary of the Dnieper lived northerners.</p>
<p>Southern boundary of land along the East Slavic tribes Dnestr occupied convict and Tivertsy.</p>
<p>In Precarpathia Croats lived.</p>
<p>Adding evidence Chronicle archaeological findings, the researchers concluded that the tribal Dulebs, Derevlyany, fields, northerners, Croats, convict and Tivertsy long had a close relationship since they were similar in language, customs, had co-sklavyny antske origin and differed in these characteristics of the neighboring north-western and north-eastern Eastern Slavic tribes. So named seven tribal groups can be considered direct ancestors Ukrainian as their language - pre-Ukrainian.</p>
<p><b>2. Neighbors East Slavic tribes</b></p>
<p>Living on land immediately bordering the steppes, Ukrainian ancestors were in constant contact with steppe nomads.</p>
<p>Centuries-old rule of Turkic nomads in the Black Sea Huns started.</p>
<p>At the end of 6. great strength became Avars. However, their stay in the Black Sea steppes were short.</p>
<p><b>Great Bulgaria and the Khazar Khanate</b></p>
<p>After the Avars left the Black Sea, where an increasing force recruited Turkic Bulgars. Approximately 635 g. Of their tribal union Great Bulgaria occupied lands of Northern Black Sea and Azov Sea.</p>
<p>Along with the Great of Bulgaria to the east of it, between the Don and the Volga and Caspian region, there is another association Turkic tribes - the Khazar Khanate.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Bulgarian and Khazar unions at odds, so soon began between military confrontation. Gore took the Khazars. Army of Great Bulgaria was divided into two bands: one migrated across the Danube, which laid the Danube Bulgaria.</p>
<p>In the Balkans Turkic Bulgars settled on lands already occupied by settlers-Slavs. Both nations agreed on peaceful coexistence. Turkic-Bulgars Slavs borrowed from their way of life, language, beliefs and soon completely dissolved between them.</p>
<p>About Turkic nomads in those lands was only Title: Bulgaria called the first Slavic state, Bulgarians called one of the modern South Slavic peoples.</p>
<p>Another horde partially recognized the power of the Khazars and obeyed them. Those Bulgar tribes who did not want to obey, migrate to the upper reaches of the Volga, where he eventually emerged Volga Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Overcoming discord among his people, the Khazars for a long time - until the late 10th century. - Ruled in the Black Sea steppes. His power they sought to extend and Slavic tribes. Chronicle indicates that the Khazars were a tribute to the fields, northerners, as well as northern East Slavic tribes - Vyatichi.</p>
<p><b>Byzantium</b></p>
<p>Did not break ties East Slavic tribes - the ancestors of the Ukrainian - and Byzantium.</p>
<p>Byzantium was their main trading partner. Moreover, the Byzantine Emperor at that time reached the northern coast of the Black Sea and Crimea.</p>
<p>Since the Black Sea was the end point of the great trade route "from the Varangians to the Greeks" Eastern Slavic tribes, which at that time controlled the middle of it, sought to expand its influence and the sea. Actually, as relations with Byzantium often worsened to a state of war.</p>
<p>These they remained long after the formation of the Kievan state.</p>
<p><b>Scandinavia</b></p>
<p>The same trade route linking East Slavic tribes from many northern peoples - ancestors of the Danes, Swedes, Norwegians.</p>
<p>The harsh living conditions at home prompted stalwart and hardy men from the north to gather in bands and military campaign to get under way in search of glory and wealth elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes they are subordinated to other nations of the earth, a tribute taxing their residents. This fate befell the northernmost East Slavic tribes Slovenes, Krivichy and non-Slavic Chud, Meyrueis.</p>
<p>Often the soldiers were hired from the north to the powerful and wealthy rulers. They served in the Byzantine emperors.</p>
<p>The Byzantines called them mercenaries varanhamy - hence the name "Vikings", whereby the eastern Slavs called representatives of the northern peoples.</p>
<p>In Western Europe about them Secondhand had another name - the Normans. The Normans, Vikings from the end of 8 cent. and in the next few centuries intervened in the history of the Eastern Slavs.</p>
<p><b>3 Princes and warriors</b></p>
<p>Even in times of peredderzhavnyy Slavic rulers were called princes.</p>
<p>Duke Power was hereditary, ie passed from father to son.</p>
<p>Slavic princes had given environment - warriors warriors.</p>
<p>They were natives of honored close to the prince of the family.</p>
<p>The main occupation of the fighters had served in the army of the prince, for which they receive a generous reward.</p>
<p>Thus, in contrast to earlier times, when soldiers became necessary for all adult men of the tribe - farmers and artisans, warriors were professional soldiers.</p>
<p>The princes and their retainers lived in large breeding centers - the settlement, which gradually turned into the city.</p>
<p><b>4. Dulib tribal alliance</b></p>
<p>One of the ancient East Slavic tribal unions were Dulibs. Their union was formed in the 7th century.</p>
<p>Archaeological excavations indicate that it united Dulebs, fields, Derevlyany, Croats, convict and Tivertsy.</p>
<p>Tribal centers Dulib Union was probably Zimne Settlement, recently found by archaeologists near Vladimir in Volhynia.</p>
<p>Zhurtuvavshys around the residents of western Volyn and Upper Dniester, East Slavic tribes - the ancestors of the Ukrainian tried to resist the devastating attacks of nomads. The chronicler tells of Dulebs, particularly in connection with the raids to the Slavic lands of the Avars.</p>
<p>In foreign sources is mention of a mysterious country Valinyanu in which modern historians see the tribal alliance Dulebs-Volyn.</p>
<p>However Dulib association was not destined to become a state. When it collapsed, the center of the Volyn state-nose in the Middle Dnieper to Kyiv.</p>
<p><b>5. The emergence of Kyiv</b></p>
<p>The oldest settlement, it can be called the settlement, was erected in Old Kiev Hill 6-8 centuries. Slavic-pre Ukrainians. Similarly, there are ancient Slavic settlement on the nearby mountains of the Castle, Yurkovitsa.</p>
<p>Most historians tend to think that ancient settlement were tribal centers Polyansky reign.</p>
<p>Many also of those who believe that Kyiv has emerged as the center of several tribal alliances, including fields, Derevlyany and northerners, as located on the border of their land.</p>
<p>Despite the legendary character, modern historians consider probable evidence "Tale of Bygone Years" on Polyansky Prince Kyi.</p>
<p><b>6. Kyiv times of the legendary Kieu</b></p>
<p>According to archaeologists, settlement Kyi was located in the northwestern part Starokyivskaya mountain, where now stands the State Historical Museum.</p>
<p>On the north side of its protected natural slope, the remaining fortifications were built. These included ditch depth of 4m, four-meter shaft and wooden fortifications. Outside the fortress housed the prince housing and various household structures.</p>
<p>During the archaeological excavations of the settlement Kyi, archaeologists found a unique discovery - the remains of ancient buildings for prayer and sacrifice - temple that provides insight into the spiritual life of the Eastern Slavs - Ukrainian ancestors.</p>
<p><b>7. The spiritual life of their ancestors Ukrainian</b></p>
<p>McDermott and his contemporaries were pagans, that is worshiped nature.</p>
<p>Since at that time the Slavs - Ukrainian ancestors had not had their own written language, their beliefs almost did not survive.</p>
<p>We know that religious event held at shrines, temples. They were the stones vymostku or depressions in the ground.</p>
<p>Most of them stood in the open air, in the center were altars and a massive pillar, on which stood a wooden or stone image of the deity - idol.</p>
<p>The most famous of those who survived - Zbrutsky idol 9.10 cc. It was found in 1848 in the river Zbruch in Ternopil.</p>
<p>At shrines, temples poryadkuvaly magicians.</p>
<p>The most important among the pagan gods in Ukrainian ancestors were deities associated with agriculture and animal husbandry. Chronicle tells of the supreme god of the eastern Slavs - the sun god Dazhdbog.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the embodiment of the sun were several deities. Yes</p>
<ul>
<li>god of the spring sun was Jari,</li>
<li>god of winter sun - Porevyt more.</li>
<li>Important gods belonged sky god Svarog,</li>
<li>god of thunder and lightning Perun, the god - protector of cattle, fertility and prosperity Velez.</li>
<li>And our ancestors worshiped spirits, goblins, Water, house and so on. They believed in the supernatural power mermaids, guardians ghoul.</li>
</ul>
<p>But even pagan beliefs were dominant at that time, pryluchalysya Ukrainian ancestors to Christianity. Faith in Jesus Christ spread to our land from Byzantium. Professed Christianity and Gothic rulers, under the authority of which were tribes sklavyniv and the Ants.</p>
