<p>Biological resources are divided into plants and animals. The ratio between the biomass of flora and fauna is shown in the pie chart.</p>
<p>Plant resources are presented wild and cultivated plants. Cultivated plants on the globe is significantly less than the wild. This map shows the eight centers of origin of cultivated plants selected and investigated by Academician NI Vavilov. For each center are examples of crops, the origin of which is related to the area.</p>
<p>Wild plants are concentrated mainly in the forests, accounting for forest resources. The forests on the globe form two zones:</p>
<p>North - forests of temperate and subtropical climates, with a predominance of coniferous trees;</p>
<p>south - subekvatorialnoho forests and equatorial zones with deciduous trees.</p>
<p>Countries outside the borders of the forest belt, suffer from a lack of forest resources.</p>
<p>The index of the territory of the forest resources is the percentage of forest (the ratio between the area and the total area of ​​forests in percent) and timber reserves. The average forest cover of the world is 30%. In South America, the figure is 52%, and in the countries of North Africa and the Persian Gulf only 1-5%.</p>
<p>The largest forests are concentrated in Russia, Canada, Brazil, the United States.</p>
<p>The forest area of ​​the northern zone from the middle of the XIX century. not significantly decreased, but the forests of the southern belt quickly disappear. Causes desolation "green lungs" of the planet are shifting cultivation, growing exports of wood and use it as fuel.</p>
