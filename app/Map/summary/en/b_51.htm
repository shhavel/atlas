<p>The African continent has been and remains the least developed region of the world, it is called a continent underdevelopment, agrarian and raw periphery of the world. All states of the continent, except South Africa, belong to developing countries. For most of them characterized by economic and political instability, the narrow specialization of the economy, low level of overall development, poverty and low life expectancy. 33 of the 47 least developed countries are in Africa. However, some countries of the continent managed through the export of raw materials to achieve relatively high GNP. Thus, in 90% of Libya's income from foreign trade make the extraction and refining; in Algeria is a major oil and natural gas, phosphates and metal ores. The main export commodity of Egypt are cotton and oil. In the production of cotton top country in Africa, and the production of high-quality long-staple cotton - first in the world.

The share of manufacturing in GDP is 25%. In a country dominated by light industry, but a large proportion of metallurgy, machine building and metal processing and chemical industries. Has significantly developed high-tech industries - military and production of nuclear reactors. An important area is the mining of the Witwatersrand - the main area of ​​production of gold and uranium. It is the largest industrial center of the country - and the capital Johannesburg - Pretoria. In the same province, near Kimberley mined diamonds. Transnational diamond-mined group De Beers controls the diamond market in the world.</p>
