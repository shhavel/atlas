<p>Rasysformuvalysya as a result of human adaptation to the ancient natural environment. This process lasted for several thousand years and, scientists believe, basically ended about 15,000 years ago distinguishing three or four major racial groups.</p>
<p>Depending on the biological modification people by skin color and other anthropological characteristics are four major races: Negroid, Caucasoid, Mongoloid and avstraloyidnu.</p>
<p>Representatives of the major races are about 70% of the planet. The rest belongs to the mixed and intermediate races.</p>
<p>Mixed and transitional forms distributed at the crossroads of major human races. Particularly intense racial mixing was in America, due to the history of the development of this part of the world. Thus, the result of the mixing of European settlers with the local Indians, Mongoloid was the creation of a new mikrorasy mestizos. Blending European importations of African blacks led to mulattos (especially in Brazil and the Caribbean islands). Population Sambo is the result of marriages of blacks with Indians.</p>
<p>Examples of mixed races and transition from other regions of the world is Malagasy Madagascar as a result of the mixing of blacks with Mongoloids and Ethiopian type and mixed-transitional forms in Sudan caused by mixing with Caucasians equatorial racial forms.</p>
<p>Note that in the modern world racial group rarely coincide with distinct people: most of the people, especially large embedded other racial formation. Exceptions are few: the Japanese, for example, retained their distinct anthropological type.</p>
