<p>The world population living in settlements of two types: urban and rural. Urban settlements are where most of the people are employed in industry and services. In rural settlements, most residents are employed in the agricultural sector of the economy. It should be noted that one size fits all criteria for classification of settlements to urban or rural non-existent. Some states by taking a legislated number of residents in settlements.</p>
<p>Urbanization (from Latin - City) - the process of urban growth, increasing urban population, increasing the role of cities in society and the spread of urban lifestyles.</p>
<p>In 2000 lived in urban areas more than half the world's population. It can be argued that urbanization is now acquired a global character. The modern stages has three characteristics.</p>
<p>1. The rapid increase in the proportion of the urban population:</p>
<ul>
<li>at the beginning of the nineteenth century. lived in urban areas 3% of the world population;</li>
<li>at the beginning of the twentieth century. lived in urban areas 14% of the world population;</li>
<li>at the beginning of the XXI century. lived in urban areas 51% of the world population.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. The further concentration of population and economy in large (more than 100 ths. Inhabitants), towns and cities-millionaires.</p>
<p>In 2000 there were approximately in 400 cities-millionaires. The largest city in the world believe Tokyo, which is home to more than 26 million inhabitants.</p>
<p>3. Expansion of urban areas and merging of closely spaced cities, united to each other by political, labor, cultural, domestic, industrial, administrative and managerial ties into a coherent whole - urban agglomeration (Latin - attach).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third millennium, there were 20 urban agglomerations and their number is growing. Highest stage of contemporary urbanization process is the formation megalopolis (from Greek - big city), resulting from the merger of neighboring agglomerations to form a unified infrastructure. At the end of the twentieth century. the world was six megalopolis, of which:</p>
<p>three in the United States:</p>
<p>BosVash - along the Atlantic from Boston to Vashnґtona with a population of about 50 million inhabitants;</p>
<p>Lakeside - on the south coast of the Great Lakes, with a population of 35 million inhabitants;</p>
<p>California (18 million inhabitants).</p>
<p>two in Europe:</p>
<p>English (consisting of the metropolitan area of ​​London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool);</p>
<p>Rhine (Randstad conurbation in the Netherlands and the Rhine-Ruhr, Rhine-Main in Germany, etc.).</p>
<p>one in Japan</p>
<p>Tokaido (the metropolitan area of ​​Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto).</p>
<p>Significant differences exist between the level and pace of urbanization. Highest level achieved in developed countries; in most developing countries, the level of urbanization is comparatively low but the urban population is growing rapidly due to migration to towns in rural areas. This is known as downy urbanization, as a sharp increase in the urban population is not accompanied by the spread of urban lifestyles.</p>
<p>During an average life expectancy demographers understand the number of years that this generation will live under the condition that throughout the life of this generation mortality of certain age groups equal to the initial level.</p>
<p>In a world with the development of civilization, there is a general upward trend in life expectancy among countries but this figure varies considerably. Thus, in developed countries it is the highest (75 years and over), and in developing countries - less than 60 years.</p>
<p>Among developing countries, slightly higher life expectancy out the newly industrialized countries of Asia and Latin America, countries rich in oil exporters (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Libya, Brunei) and wealthy island Caribbean , Seychelles and Reunion (France), Indian Ocean, Nauru, Guam (US), and others - in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The lowest life expectancy - in most African countries. This is an extremely low standard of living on the continent, poor medical care, frequent military and ethnic conflicts.</p>
<p>Natural population growth - a measure which, together with the birth rate and death rate characterizes the dynamics of the continuous recovery of generations, ie the reproduction of the population. Quantity that characterizes the natural growth rate is the rate of natural increase. It is calculated as the difference between the crude birth rate and death rate (per 1 000 ths. Inhabitants).</p>
