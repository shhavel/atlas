<p><b>Personality</b></p>
<p>Konstantin Ostrog (c. 1460 - 1530) - one of the most respected members of the most powerful princely family, uncrowned king of, as they said. Traditionally, reaching more Kievan Rus, and by vocation, he took care of the Orthodox church and cultural life. However, most became famous as the commander. Contemporaries portrayed him as a man of low stature and unprepossessing physique, modest and unpretentious. But the prince Constantine seems perevtilyuvavsya on the battlefield - there he was calm and neshytnym, as befits knights. Very brave, he never lost his sanity in the hottest moments and skillfully led the army. It is no coincidence Prince was a favorite of the King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Sigismund, who showered him with honors and titles. Leadership career Ostrozky began after defeating enemies used in the 90's. Year 1497 he became governor of castles and fortresses in the winery and Bratslav taking responsibility for defense against raids Krimchaks. In the same year he led the forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania - it was hetman. During the battle of Moscow army in 1500 on the river Vedroshi Siversky captured. A few years was in exile, but soon returned home. The wages of Vedroshivsku defeat was the Battle of Orsha in 1514 in which Ostrog won a convincing victory.</p>

None of Ukrainian princes never reached in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the situation. According to researchers, the prince was the fourth person in the state of prosperity and had about 60 thousand. Subjects.</p>
<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. The leading role of the nobility as top Ukrainian society in contemporary political life</b></p>
<p>After Krevsk Union, and especially after the defeat Švitrigaila many Ukrainian and Belarusian princes lost their fiefdoms.</p>
<p>There was a gradual convergence prince layers with other privileged classes and as a consequence the single privileged class - the gentry.</p>
<p>From the mid-15th century. in most Ukrainian lands established this structure dominant state: princes - gentlemen - zem'yany-Gentry - Gentry-rabble - armored nobles.</p>
<p>This structure continued until the mid-17th century.</p>
<p>However even completely impoverished princes were more likely to receive high government compared to less noble, even and wealthy nobleman.</p>
<p>In addition, the rulers acted in public service to the Lithuanian, and Polish nations, while maintaining their principality and receiving from the state to private ownership and lifelong holding large land holdings.</p>
<p>So princely families of Ostrog, Vyshnevetsky Koretsky, Czartoryski family, Zbarazkiy held a prominent government positions in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, sat on the board of the Grand Duke, and in military campaigns were under their own banners.</p>
<p><b>Loss of Ukrainian state-princes role</b></p>
<p>With the increasing influence of the Polish rulers lost their ability at the national level to decide the fate of their homeland - she increasingly began to depend on the will of foreign capitals: free or Krakow.</p>
<p>However princely families still had power and authority to do local governance. Dividing each other first Volhynia and later Central Ukraine, they have assumed real power on the ground.</p>
<p>Their possessions prince acted right with their own taxes and seizures. It was his army.</p>
<p>So locally, seemed to have remained the same as for the Middle Ages.</p>
<p><b>Actually, as representatives of the princely families linked their genealogies of the princes of Kievan Rus.</b></p>
<p><b>In contemporary Ukraine occupied a special place family Ostrog.</b></p>
<p><b>Lords and gentry: the struggle for equal rights for all members of the aristocratic strata</b></p>
<p>To the higher strata of contemporary Ukrainian society, except the princes, were also lords. The word "lord" in the 16th century. meant the original title.</p>
<p>Yes, and Bratslavshchina Kiev and the first half of the 16th century. 450 noble families manor called about a hundred.</p>
<p>The main feature of Mr. was that he owned, though small, but its own, grandfather, great-grandfather, otchynnym ground.</p>
<p>As is known, from the Kievan Rus was a large segment of the Knights of the boyars, who held the land-seniority - estates granted by the Grand Duke of military service.</p>
<p>Kept they in later times. However, Mr unlike the nobleman who had to settle where he will give the land of the prince, was granted the hereditary possession of land of their ancestors.</p>
<p>Largest layer aristocratic strata were gentry - zem'yany.</p>
<p>Some of them had the right to dispose of their estates, which were their private property, and the rest used the land, subject to conscription.</p>
<p>After losing ground, these nobles fell into the category of nobility, ragamuffins.</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of life in Ukraine was that, despite the heterogeneity of the eternal, noble stratum wanted to get a general rights and privileges, and therefore completely separate from the rest of society.</p>
<p>And if princes had the rights for the fact of its birth, middle and gentry had their fight.</p>
<p>Changes in the position of the nobility are reflected in the legislative code of the time - charter Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the edition 1529 - First (or Old) Lithuanian Statute.</p>
<p>According to him, the gentry were guaranteed that it can not be punished without trial.</p>
<p>It also provided the gentry land ownership, which could not take away the "no-fault".</p>
<p><b>So, at the end of the 16th century. Ukrainian nobility succeeded in consolidating law rights which for centuries has gained them a sword, carrying those heavy military duties.</b></p>
<p>In Galicia from the mid-15th century. Galician nobles were equalized with the Polish gentry. This led to what is already in the 16th century. in the province remained boyar families who have kept the Ukrainian tradition.</p>
<p><b>2. Ukrainian Church and the state of the clergy</b></p>
<p>There is still a special place in Ukrainian society occupied the clergy, which was a separate social groups.</p>
<p>According to researchers spiritual condition was fairly large, it belonged to almost a tenth of the population - priests with their families, monks, people who serve the church.</p>
<p>Insulation clergy manifested in the fact that it was not subject to secular court.</p>
<p><b>During the 14th - 16th century. the Orthodox church and the clergy were not the same.</b></p>
<p>In the 14th century. Orthodox, Ruthenian, faith was adopted by the Lithuanian princes.</p>
<p>The authority of the Orthodox Church, which was supported by most of the population Ukrainian lands remained quite high, however, the gradual spread of Catholicism among the princely court, the pressure from the Catholic state, which was Poland, became increasingly stronger.</p>
<p>After Krevsk Union of Orthodox Lithuanians and Lithuanian pagans were gathered to Catholicism.</p>
<p>Lithuanian Catholic boyars equalized the rights of the Polish gentry.</p>
<p>But the act that showed the division of society on religious grounds, and opened the way for the oppression of the Orthodox Union became Horodelska 1413, according to which participation in government and to hold government positions have the right to exclusively Catholic.</p>
<p>However, certain guarantees of their position in the Ukrainian Orthodox were aristocracy, whose members were constantly on the board of the Grand Duke of Lithuania and the highest post.</p>
<p>On the Ukrainian territory, which was distributed to Polish administrative and political structure of the Orthodox church was difficult.</p>
<p>A characteristic feature of policy powers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania regarding the Orthodox Church was the desire to have within their state independent church organization and rid the church depends Muscovy.</p>
<p>In the mid-15th century. finally there was a division of the Kiev Metropolia of Kiev and Moscow.</p>
<p>Cathedral of the Moscow bishops without the approval of Constantinople put a single metropolitan of Kiev remained its metropolitan subordinate to the Patriarch of Constantinople.</p>
<p><b>And no matter how difficult was the position of the Orthodox Church, it has also become a defender and representative of Ukrainian and Belarusian people in the Catholic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the focus of Ukrainian and Belarusian culture and spirituality.</b></p>
<p><b>3. The position of Ukrainian peasants</b></p>
<p>The lowest point of the social pyramid that society sat the peasants who were the largest layer - up to 80% of the population.</p>
<p>As before, the villagers living communities.</p>
<p>Arable land divided between the parts of the community - yard, which brings together some "smoke" (courtyards), ie economies of individual families.</p>
<p>A variety of taxes to the state and feudal rural community also distributed among the yard.</p>
<p>The community elected its own judgment. He was called dig the "cop" - a collection of communities.</p>
<p>Gradually dig trial court was replaced by a very feudal lords (patrimonial) and community land now owned by feudal lords.</p>
<p>Historians conventionally divided villagers into "mortgage" (personally free) and "nepohozhyh" (attached to their inheritance).</p>
<p>In addition, the nature of duties among farmers distinguish, Danes, traction, servants.</p>
<p>Tributaries - the largest group of "mortgage" farmers - called those whose primary duty was to pay tribute in kind or money for the use of arable lands and lands.</p>
<p>Some farmers had to work in the household of his ruler with his "pulled" (draft animals and equipment), that serve serfdom.</p>
<p>A privileged position among the peasants had servants who engaged in agriculture, while serving military service in the border castles. They took part in military campaigns, carried out various assignments.</p>
<p><b>4. Strengthen exploitation and restriction of personal freedom of the peasants</b></p>
<p>During the 15th - early 16th century. in the life of Ukrainian peasants there were significant changes, the essence of which was to limit personal freedom, gradual enslavement.</p>
<p>By that time in Ukraine was gaining strength and continued to develop great feudal tenure - tycoon.</p>
<p>It grew from donations Grand Duke, capture wasteland communal lands.</p>
<p>By the mid-16th century. vacant land as communal land and free community almost gone.</p>
<p>The second half of the 15th century. unfolded grain production for sale in Western Europe.</p>
<p>The nobility of Galicia and Western Volhynia begins to lay Filvarky.</p>
<p>With the expansion of manors landowners were interested in the work of farmers landed gentry, the "pulled" and limiting the rights of farmers switch. Number of "nepohozhyh" peasants from year to year.</p>
<p>The first known document that initiated the enslavement of the peasants, according to the decision of the gentry in Galicia in 1435 After him the farmer had the right to go to the landowner only for Christmas, paying him a large ransom.</p>
<p>Ukrainian lands in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania started zakripachuvaty farmers from 1447 according to the privilege of Casimir IV.</p>
<p>Enslaving the bulk of the peasants was stated in contemporary codes of laws - famous Lithuanian Statute (known to all three editions: 1529, 1566 and 1588). For First Lithuanian Statute, the grand privilege and Polish legislation, customary law fully protect the interests of landowners, their legal status.</p>
<p><b>5. Social by peasants</b></p>
<p>Ukrainian peasants did not put up with increasing social exploitation and fought against it, often taking up arms.</p>
<p>The most important speech of this period was the uprising of Ukrainian and Moldovan farmers in Pokuttya and Northern Bukovina, part of Moldavia (1490-1492 gg.).</p>
<p>Researchers stress that it was not only anti-social but also liberating character, that was intended not only to improve the situation of the peasants as social class (reduction obligations), and pursued national liberation because farmers were from other people, and those in power - more.</p>
<p>In the ranks of the rebels, in addition to Ukrainian and Moldavian peasants, commoners were even representatives of the Ukrainian Orthodox nobility.</p>
<p>Campaigns against the Polish troops led by Mucha.</p>
<p>Year 1491 insurgency resumed. The case continued predecessor Andrei Bahrul. However, both peasant uprisings were suppressed.</p>
<p>His contribution to the struggle against the oppressors and the workers did Transcarpathia, who took an active part in the peasant war in Hungary in 1514 led Doji.</p>
<p><b>6. The growth of cities</b></p>
<p>By the mid-17th century. on the lands of Ukraine around 1100 cities and towns. Although the debate about what constitutes the then city among scholars do not cease.</p>
<p>One of the largest cities of Kyiv was. By the mid-17th century. Kyiv had about 10 thousand. Residents.</p>
<p>In the 16 th century. Bratslav and Kremenets had about 5 ths. Inhabitants Luck - 4 thousand. Vladimir, Vinnitsa, Zhitomir, Kano, Ostrog 2 to 4 thousand.</p>
<p>Among cities of Galicia, skirts and other Western Ukrainian lands that were part of Poland, was the largest Lions (According to scientists at the beginning of the 15th century. - About 10 thousand. In the first half of the 17th century. 25-30 thousand). .</p>

<p>In urban areas, especially in Galicia, inhabited by representatives of different nations. In Volyn and dominated lands of Central Ukraine Ukrainian.</p>
<p><b>Magdeburg Law</b></p>
<p>In the late 15th - early 16th century. in Ukrainian cities spread Magdeburg Law.</p>
<p>Magdeburg Law gave various economic benefits.</p>
<p>Under this law led the city council - a body uniting board and bench.</p>
