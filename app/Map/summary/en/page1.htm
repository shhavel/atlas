<p><b>Water in nature</b></p>
<p>Water in nature is in three states: liquid, solid, gaseous. Liquid state - a river, lakes, seas and oceans. Solid state - is ice, which turns the water after cooling. Gaseous state - a pair, which turns the water after heating. It is water in a gaseous state forms clouds, which rain falls to the earth and other sediments.</p>
<p>Three quarters of the globe covered by the waters of the oceans. It is divided into 4 parts continents called oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Arctic. The water in them salty.</p>
<p>Oceans enriching the air with oxygen, because it grows much green algae. Also, there resides a large number of fish, marine animals and other living organisms.</p>
<p>Plenty of water evaporates from the surface of oceans and turning into water vapor forms clouds, which in turn fall precipitation (rain, snow, fog, dew).</p>
<p>Ponds land (sea, rivers, lakes, swamps, springs, ponds and reservoirs), which arose naturally called natural and man-made - artificial.</p>
<p>Sea - a part of the ocean that cuts into the land. Salt water in them, as in the oceans. Ukraine is washed by the Black and Azov Seas, belonging to the basin of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>River - a stream of water that has leaked (source, lake, marsh, or ice) and is fed by surface and groundwater. Burying through which flows the river is called the channel. The place where the river empties into another body of water - the mouth. But the rest of the river, whose waters flow into the main river - a tributary. Among the major rivers in Ukraine are the Dnieper, Danube, Dniester, Southern Bug, Seversky Donets.</p>
<p>Lake - a body of water that occurs in natural cavities on the surface of the earth and replenishes water year, ground water sources, rain and melt water. In Ukraine, about 20 thousand lakes (Shatsky, Synevyr Yalpuh, Cahul, Siwash and others)</p>
<p>Swamp - area too damp earth's surface.</p>
<p>Source - a place where the Earth's surface flows underground water. Power generated at the bottom of ravines, gullies, on slopes of hills, steep river banks.</p>
<p>Most particles of the earth reserves account for salt water seas and oceans, less - fresh water lakes, rivers, glaciers, ground water and water vapor.</p>
