<p>From 1682 he held the position of captain general in the government of left-bank hetman.</p>
<p>Emergency education, experience, ґrechnist Mazepa admired. Not surprisingly, also for Polish kings, and Ukrainian hetman, and Prince Golitsyn - naykulturnishoyi rights in Muscovy - Mazeppa had great authority, and the most popular person among the Cossack elite. Therefore, the arrival of its hetman in 1687 was quite natural.</p>
<p><b>SIGNING PAPERS Kolomaksky 1687 with Moscow</b></p>
<p>His Hetman Ivan Mazepa began with the signing Kolomaksky articles.</p>
<p>Agreement between the Hetman and the rulers on the one hand, and the Muscovite tsars Ivan and Peter and Princess Sophia - the other, was signed July 25, 1687</p>

<p>Some changes that Kolomaksky article differed from the previous (in particular Articles 18-20), had a gain in the Hetmanate tsarist authorities and further restricting the rights and hetman's government.</p>
<p><b>For Kolomaksky Articles</b></p>
<p>Hetman had no right without the king's decree deprive officers of executive positions, and the officers - Drop hetman.</p>
<p>Significantly limited the right to dispose of Hetman military lands.</p>
<p>Hetman government was forbidden to maintain diplomatic relations with other states.</p>
<p>Supposed placement in the Hetman's capital - the city. Baturin - Moscow regiment of riflemen.</p>
<p>Hetman had to resort to special measures to "unite all the forces in a strong and indissoluble consent of both nations n"; to "Little did not call earth Hetman, but only recognized the land, which is in the king's autocratic power." Item 19 Kolomaksky articles attributed to such events, including marriages between Ukrainian and Muscovites.</p>
<p>Article Kolomaksky determined Hetman government as an obedient tool for implementation in Ukraine Moscow policy to complete elimination of the Ukrainian state, the more "transparency" of Ukraine's borders with Moscow, as well as the gradual but steady "dissolution" of the Moscow Ukrainian population.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN POLICY</b></p>
<p>On the directions of foreign policy of the Mazepa some extent indicate Kolomaksky article.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Hetman Ivan Mazepa thought that can make your plans for Ukraine only in union with Russia, relations with which, in his opinion, were built on the basis of Ukrainian-Moscow Treaty in 1654</p>
<p>With the support of Moscow Mazepa was hoping to extend the territory of the Hetmanate on reclaimed from Poland Right-bank Ukraine and steppe line along the Black Sea and Sea of ​​Azov, which owned the Crimea and Turkey.</p>
<p>The choice of another ally at that time matured as Mazeppa not trust in Poland and a negative attitude toward union with the Crimea and Turkey.</p>

<p>The defining feature of his domestic policy was to unite the land of the Left Bank, the Right Bank, Kharkiv and Ukraine Slobozhanshchina in a single, which seemed like the newly elected Hetman state of Western design with traditional Cossack system.</p>

<p><b>Renaissance Cossack system into right UKRAINE</b></p>
<p>In an effort to unite all Ukrainian lands under the same mace, Mazepa never produced from the account Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>At the end of the XVII century. much of the land lay desolate Right Bank. This worried the Polish government are spoiled because of bloody wars and the mass exodus of the population, which are free to attack the Turkish-Tatar hordes threatening to resume the eastern provinces.</p>
<p>The only reliable way to reduce this threat settlement was devastated land.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Polish King Jan III Sobieski again turned to the Cossacks.</p>
<p>Encouraging settlement wasteland, the Polish government decision in 1685 gave the Cossacks' privileges and true freedom. "</p>
<p>In accordance with the decree of the Cossacks built on occupied land they own regimental-centesimal.</p>
<p>Yes recovered four regiments: Bohuslav, Korsun, Bratslav, Fastivskyi (Bilotserkivskiy) led by Colonel Samiylo I. (Samus), Zachary spark, Andrew Abazinia and seven Pale.</p>
<p>Recovered regiments were not only military, but also the administrative-territorial units.</p>
<p>Each of the colonels encouraged settlement wasteland helped to create in the towns and villages of the Cossack authorities, including Cossacks courts.</p>
<p>Particularly active in the revival of Cossack colonel Fastivskyi marked down seven Pale.</p>
<p><b>National liberation uprising 1702-1704 biennium.</b></p>

<p>Saeima adopted to eliminate the right-bank Cossacks hetman and then ordered to disband their armies colonels.</p>
<p>After the capture of Polish troops in winter 1702 Cossack several cities in Right-Bank Ukraine in response to an uprising, headed by Semyon pile.</p>
<p>This liberation movement was aimed at the liberation of Right-Bank Ukraine from Polish rule and unification of the Left-Bank Hetmanate.</p>
<p>In July 1702 the movement has captured Kyiv region, and in early 1703 the rebels have controlled a significant portion of the Right-Bank Ukraine. The revolt spread to Volhynia and Podolia, came to Galicia. 15000th army abandoned for its suppression, stop liberation movement failed.</p>
<p>Rebels Paly became allies of the Swedes, who at that time were at war with the Poles - because 1700 started the Swedish-Moscow (North) war.</p>
<p>This alarmed Moscow, which immediately responded to the request of the Polish King August II to help, but used for the troops Mazepa.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1704 the army of Hetman Mazepa crossed the Dnieper and occupied Kiev and Volhynia.</p>
<p>Semen was arrested and imprisoned Palia (a year later he was sent to Moscow and then exiled to Siberia).</p>
<p>Poland, much of which was occupied by Swedish troops could not really claim the Right Bank Ukraine.</p>
<p>In such circumstances the right bank found itself under the rule of Mazepa.</p>
<p>Union of Right-Bank Ukraine by Mazepa lasted from 1704 to the events of 1708-1709.</p>
