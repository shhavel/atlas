<p>Total reserves of water on Earth is over 1 387 million cubic km., But of which only 2.5% is fresh water land (pie chart). Composition of fresh water in the world is given on a cylindrical diagram. Really usable is a small fraction of water in rivers and freshwater lakes. Much of the same volume of fresh water located in underdeveloped and remote areas.</p>
<p>The distribution of the world's freshwater resources is quite uneven and depends on the geographical location of the area and the natural environment.</p>
<p>World reserves of fresh water can not be increased, while water consumption is growing, besides the water becomes dirty and unusable. Because the planet is already the problem of scarcity of fresh water. Water shortage is still a largely regional in nature. He was particularly felt in areas with dry climates where providing full resources of river runoff per capita less than 5 thousand. Cubic meters. per year. Agriculture in these areas is possible on irrigated lands.</p>
<p>Address the problem of water shortages are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>- Reduction of water consumption in agriculture;</li>
<li>- Introduction to the industry and shallow waterless technology, closed water (reuse of waste water);</li>
<li>- Seawater desalination, water use icebergs;</li>
<li>- Construction of reservoirs that regulate the river flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a world built more than 60,000 reservoirs. The largest of them are shown on the map. In Ukraine, on the Dnieper cascade reservoirs built a surrounding building hydropower plants. However, the reservoir and create significant challenges - changing riverbeds, flood fertile coastal lands, climate change and so on.</p>
