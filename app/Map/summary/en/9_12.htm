<p>Ukraine in the Crimean War of 1853-1856. The peasant movement of 1855-1860.</p>
<p>As the "gendarme of Europe", after the suppression of the revolution of 1848-1849. Russian tsarism felt that strengthened its position in Europe and can begin to address important an "Eastern Question." Russia sought to establish control over the Balkans and the Black Sea straits.</p>
<p>The reason for the deployment of military operations against the Ottoman Empire was the conflict over the holy places in Palestine, related to the life of Jesus Christ. In June 1853, Russian troops suddenly crossed the border with Turkey and occupied the Danubian principalities. Making sure to support Britain and France, who did not want to strengthen the position of the Russian Tsar, the Turkish sultan declared war on Russia. First course of actions consisted beneficial for Russia.</p>
<p>Russian troops resisted the attack of the Turkish troops in the Caucasus, while themselves began to move to Bulgaria, laid siege to the important fortress of Silistra on the Danube. The Turkish Black Sea fleet was utterly destroyed the Russian fleet in Sinop bay. The victory was not part of the plan of the great powers.</p>
<p>Austria and Prussia demanded the king to withdraw from the Danube principalities. Faced with international isolation, Nicholas was forced to surrender. However, in March 1854 the UK, France and Sardinia declared war on Russia. Still ahead on the sea, Anglo-French forces first resorted to attacks from the sea in Odessa, Nikolaev, Sevastopol and other cities. In April 1854 the Allied fleet at hand Odessa and began to bombard the city. During the second attack, one of the British frigate ran aground and his team was forced to surrender. The third attack in July was also unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Active participation in the defense of the coast from the River. Odessa Danube Danube Cossacks took (Ust-Danube) army.</p>
<p>In early September 1854 the Anglo-French troops landed on the Crimean n-mo in the area of ​​Evpatoria. After the defeat in the Battle on the River. Alta imperial army led by Prince O.Menshykova retreated northward, leaving their fate main naval base of the Russian Black Sea - Sevastopol.</p>
<p>The war proved a huge military-technical superiority of the Allied armed with the latest technology. In the absence of railways n command (as opposed to the enemy, who used ships) could not timely provide the army with all necessary.</p>
<p>Beginning of the siege of Sevastopol. She carried 60,000th army allies. The garrison consisted of base 18 thousand. People in addition to the defensive attracted 20 thousand. Sailors. Defense of the city led P.Nahimov Admirals, V. Kornilov, V.Istomin. With this balance of forces attackers are unlikely to be able to get the main base if they did not have the advantage in arms and ammunition. Old Russian gun did not go in comparison with artillery allies - the rapid-fire, long-range and accurate. In other words, for every 10 enemy artillery rounds defenders of Sevastopol could answer only one. After repeated assaults of the Anglo-French troops succeeded in capturing the Malakhov Hill, the main reference point in the defense of the city.</p>
<p>On the 349 th day of fighting, Russian troops were forced to leave their positions in the southern part of the city, but continued to hold the northern sector of defense. In defense of the city actively participated scouts (scouts) Black Sea Cossack troops who carried out attacks on enemy positions. Courage, intelligence, and ability to apply a brilliant stratagem distinguished themselves in the defense of Sevastopol P.Kishka sailor and nurse D.Sevastopolska. Exemplary medical service organized in Pirogov, which in practice has developed fundamental principles of the doctrine of military surgery. During the heroic epic of Sevastopol tsarist government, with incalculable human and material resources, and failed to send fresh troops to the Crimea. This weakness was due to military-technical and economic backwardness of feudal empires, and the constant threat of invasion across the western border of Russia. The deployment of military operations in the Balkans, and later transformed in Crimea Ukraine in the near rear troops. The territory of Ukraine was a source of replenishment of food and new recruits. Under the influence of the war in Ukraine turned mass anti-serfdom movement in 1855 - "Kiev Cossacks", and in 1856 - "in Tavria for freedom."</p>
<p>The reason for this was the king's manifesto of 25 January 1855 on the establishment of mobile militia. Farmers perceived the manifest content as release from bondage. They massively recorded in "Cossacks", refusing to perform duties. In February 1855 in the Kiev province the peasants spread across 9 counties. The government has thrown 16 squadrons of cavalry, infantry battalion, two companies of sappers. There were bloody clashes between rebels and troops, 39 villagers were killed, 63 - were wounded. This movement is called "Kiev Cossacks."</p>
<p>In April 1856 a second account for the peasants - the so-called March "in Tavria for freedom." After the end of the Crimean War among the peasants dispersed rumors that you can move to the Crimean Peninsula, the government will provide substantial assistance and release from serfdom. In the summer of 1856 at Perekopa gathered tens of thousands of peasants. But government forces managed to stop the movement.</p>
<p>But peasant unrest continued. The Crimean War revealed the economic, political and military-technical backwardness. War further aggravated the crisis of the feudal system.</p>
<p>In March 1856 the Paris Peace Treaty was signed on terms dictated by the victors. Russia was deprived of the right to have the navy and fortresses on the Black Sea. The mouth of the Danube again passed under the rule of Turkey.</p>
<p>During the war, in February 1855, died Nicholas II was the heir to the throne by his son, Alexander II, who had become a great reformer, as Russia badly needed reforms.</p>
