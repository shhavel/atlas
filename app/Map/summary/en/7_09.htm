<p><b>Personality</b></p>
<p>Svyatoslav I. (c. 939 - 972 years.) - Grand Prince of Kyiv (945-972 gg.). Son of Prince Igor and Princess Olga. All public events Sviatoslav I. if denied Holguin: princess was zealous Christian, and Svyatoslav stubbornly stuck to paganism; at the time of Olga did not happen any confrontation with its neighbors, Sviatoslav however, are always at war; Olga took care of the internal affairs of States, and Svyatoslav despise them, for which he blamed Kiev: "You, prince, a strange land looking for and care about her, and left her ..." But despite this chronicler tell of Svyatoslav with extraordinary sympathy, bowing before leadership talent, courage, chivalrous zvytyazhnistyu and sincerity: "Sam was brave and easy. Walking, like pardus, many wars he did. Carts but it is not a driving or told not taken, no meat is cooking, but potonku cut into horse or beast, or Wolowyna charcoal spikshy, he ate. Even the tent he had, and pitnyk fame and put a saddle at the head. These are all the other warriors with him. And he sent messengers to other lands, saying, "I want you to go." It Sviatoslav put into the mouth of expressions, which was destined to become a cruise: "Dead shame do not know", "not posoromymo Russian land" and so on. Interesting evidence of Svyatoslav and keep foreign source. For example, the Byzantine historian Leo the Deacon left sketch n prince: "The emperor agreed to negotiate in a gilded arms, on horseback came to the bank of the Danube, accompanied by a large group of riders that shining weapon. Sviatoslav pereyizdyv the river in a boat and sitting on a paddle tomb along with other without any difference. In appearance he was: medium height, not too high, not too low, bushy eyebrows, with blue eyes, flat nose, with a shaved beard and thick mustache. His head was completely naked, but only on one side of it hung a strand of hair, which meant that kind of nobility; neck stout, strong, broad shoulders and the entire state rather slim. He seemed dark and wild. In one ear strymila his gold ring, adorned with two pearls with rubies, set in the midst of them. Clothes on it was white, nothing but purity, the other not great. "</p>
<p><b>1. The beginning of the reign of Olga</b></p>
<p>Tragic death of Prince Igor has forced the state to take over the reins of his wife - Princess Olga: it's Regiment son of Prince Svyatoslav, according to the Chronicle, was still too small.</p>
<p>According to scientists, the death of Igor was associated with the desire tribal alliances, including Derevlyany, lose power dynasty and establish his own dynasty in Kiev.</p>
<p>To put an end to harassment derevlyanskoyi nobility, Olga had to act wisely and decisively.</p>
<p>To date not preserved any details about how it overcame Olga antyryurykivski mood Derevlyany. Winning the Kiev authorities and the final conquest Derevlyany embodied in the legendary stories chronicle the three revenge of Princess Olga.</p>
<p>Double Olga came ambassadors from Derevlyany, seeking his posvataty derevlyanskoho Little Prince - and twice found in Kiev death. Then Olga cunning overcame derevlyansku army, and Iskorosten (derevlyansku capital) besieged. Finally imposed on the vanquished iskorostentsiv tribute light - a few sparrows and pigeons from the court. Derevlyany not understand what is the meaning of the riddle wise Olga - and suffered a final defeat.</p>
<p><b>Olga for the first time in the history of the Russian state resorted to measures that involved the elimination of local knyazhin: it abolished the Board derevlyanskoho Little Prince, subjecting derevlyansku land directly Kyiv.</b></p>
<p><b>2. Reforms Olga</b></p>
<p>According to the Chronicle, Olga, subdued Derevlyany, undertaken to organize the collection of tribute - in order to prevent future outbreaks of discontent, similar to those which resulted in her husband died.</p>
<p>Princely power was provided in different sizes and types of tribute: a chronicle of named custom, lessons dues.</p>
<p>Nearby major cities Olga pozakladala cemeteries - administrative and economic centers where members of princely power regularly collected tribute set, the court did so. Olga So, according to this interpretation, seasonal polyude replaced regularly collect tribute in the cemeteries.</p>
<p><b>3. Foreign policy of Princess Olga. A visit to Constantinople.</b></p>
<p>Strategic partners of the Russian state at the time of Olga remained Byzantium.</p>
<p>More or less the usual date for the trip to Constantinople Olga is 957 g., Although the chronicler calls another. Installed it on the testimony of the Byzantine emperor, party events, Kostantyna Porphyrogenitus, who left the memories of the two imperial feasting Ruthenian princess, pointing not only to give each and days of the week on which they fell.</p>
<p>Embassy Princess consisted of 100 most respected persons, among them - Holguin nephew, n princess and boyar, priest, ambassadors and translators merchants. Together with the servants, soldiers and sailors suite Olga was almost fifteen hundred people.</p>
<p>The purpose of the trip to Constantinople Olga vytlumachuyetsya ambiguous. Chronicler and hagiography reason of the visit saw Olga in an effort to be baptized.</p>
<p>In the annals told that arrived in Constantinople, Princess became a Christian and that her godfather was the Emperor. However, Constantine Porphyrogenitus the baptism of Olga in his memoirs did not mention a single word.</p>
<p><b>So, going to Tsargrad, Princess Olga wanted to resume peace intergovernmental agreement between Rus and Byzantium - after the manners of the time the agreement operated until living ruled that concluded it. Death of Prince Igor and Olga encouraged to go to Constantinople by the new text of the agreement. However, it concluded vochevydyachky not. And the relations of Byzantium and, quite naturally, became cooler.</b></p>
<p><b>Attempts to establish relations with the German Empire</b></p>
<p>Some easing of relations with Byzantium led Olga to look for another strong ally.</p>
<p>In Western sources preserved evidence about embassy of Princess Olga, was sent to 959 Germanic Emperor Otto I.</p>
<p>Rus' envoys were empowered to ask Germanic ruler sent to Kyiv high priests to spread Christianity, and to seek the establishment of relations of "peace and friendship".</p>
<p>Otto I granted the request of the princess in the 961. Sent to Kyiv several priests led by Bishop Adalbert, however, expand the activities in the Ruthenian lands they could not.</p>
<p>At the end of the life of Olga princely power weakened. Evidence of this was a complete change in state policy voknyazhinnyam 964 g. Olzhynoho son - Svyatoslav.</p>
<p><b>4. Measures for the spread of Christianity</b></p>
<p>The name of Olga link building several churches in Kiev, including the Church of St. Nicholas at the grave of Askold and the church of St. Sophia.</p>
<p>Persistence of Olga in the spread of Christianity was duly appreciated descendants for whom a Christian princess, was the figurative words of the chronicler, "harbinger of Christian lands as Morning star and the sun arose before the world."</p>
<p><b>For several centuries, according to historians - not later than the 13th century., Olga began to honor as holy.</b></p>
<p><b>5. Foreign Policy prince-warrior</b></p>
<p><b>The campaign against Khazaria</b></p>
<p>Year 964, as the Chronicle Svyatoslav went to the Oka and hike the Volga, aiming to conquer the Khazar Khanate.</p>
<p>The campaign lasted two years. During this time, was overcome Volga Bulgars and Burtases (Mordovians) jars and Kasogs.</p>
<p>Before Rus swords could not resist and most powerful fortresses of Khazaria - Samandar city, located near the Caspian Sea, the city Sarkel that Don and the capital of the Khanate Itil, that in the mouth of the Volga.</p>
<p>Military presence in the lands of Rus Khazaria so undermined the strength of the state, to restore the former greatness, it failed and soon collapsed.</p>
<p>And despite the big victories Svyatoslav, few historians assesses its policy on Khazaria positive. After the Khazar Khanate, as if a shield to defend Russian lands from attacks of numerous Eastern nomads. With the demise of Khazaria nomadic hordes moved to.</p>
<p>Reclaimed land in the east had to be protected, and the strength of the Rus lacking.</p>
<p><b>Thus, territorial acquisition by Sviatoslav short time has been lost.</b></p>
<p><b>First Balkan campaign of Svyatoslav</b></p>
<p>No less ambitious and just as little Svyatoslav campaign was effective in the Balkans. Launched 967 g., It lasted several years and consisted of two trips.</p>
<p>As historians believe, the first expedition against Bulgaria Sviatoslav led the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus.</p>
<p>Aware of the committed Sviatoslav Khazaria defeat, he sought to force Russian troops to subdue arbitrary Bulgarian rulers.</p>
<p>However, many researchers analyzed the events and concluded that Sviatoslav was in the Balkans and self-interest.</p>
<p>Through active aggressive policy towards the south, he dreamed of a new Velikoknyazheskaya residence - closer to areas where the fighting.</p>
<p>So, Svyatoslav over 968. Quickly moved the Lower Danube, and soon "took eighty gardens on the Danube, and sat down knyazyuyuchy there in the garden Pereyaslavtsi taking tribute ..."</p>
<p>This development is not consistent with our foreign policy, the Byzantine Empire, which she preferred to rule in the Balkans. So soon Sviatoslav had already fought against the troops of the emperor.</p>
<p>Not in favor of Sviatoslav consisted circumstances. In the summer of 968 BC. Pereyaslavtsi received news of mortal danger that threatened Kyiv, taking advantage of the absence of the Grand Duke and his wife came to the Rus capital horde of Pechenegs and surrounded her.</p>
<p>Svyatoslav had as soon as possible to return to Kyiv. On the Danube, he was able to return only 970.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Balkans, Svyatoslav significant changes have taken place: the Byzantine throne established a new emperor John Tzimiskes who resorted to all diplomatic measures to persuade Sviatoslav give up his attacks on the Balkans.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian government has entered into an agreement with Byzantium allied and began to struggle against Rus pledge of Danubian fortresses. So, Sviatoslav had again taken up arms.</p>
<p><b>Second Balkan campaign</b></p>
<p>At the beginning of the campaign Svyatoslav conquered nearly all of Bulgaria, crossed the Balkan Mountains and invaded Thrace.</p>
<p>However, in the battle of Arkadiopolem Svyatoslav defeated - the first in my life.</p>
<p>This forced him to return to the Danube and to gain a foothold in Dorostoli (now Silistra in Bulgaria). In the spring of 971. Here come the troops of the Byzantine emperor.</p>
<p>Svyatoslav and his wife was in the siege, which lasted three months. Finally exhausted opponents agreed to negotiate.</p>
<p>There were at the highest level they personally met the Russian princes and the Byzantine Emperor.</p>
<p>Under the contract 971. Sviatoslav refused to claim the Byzantine possessions in the Crimea and the Danube, the Byzantine emperor was obliged to miss Rus home and continue to treat them as friends.</p>
<p>After reaching an agreement with Svyatoslav, the Byzantine ruler secretly told Khan Pechenegs Kure that are depleted long hike Rus returned with much booty home.</p>
<p>Near the Dnieper rapids Pechenegs blocked the way to Kyiv. Realistically assessing the balance of power, Svyatoslav went to Biloberezhzhya, to winter there.</p>
<p>In early March, 972. Prince went to Kyiv. And the doors of his Pechenegs attacked. In battle, killing many Rus. Put the head and the Grand Duke.</p>
<p><b>6. Domestic Policy Sviatoslav</b></p>
<p>Sviatoslav little concerned about domestic affairs. At first he entrusted their mother - Princess Olga, after her death, the year 969, authorized to exercise the supreme power of his sons, giving Kyiv Jaropelk, Derevlyansku land - Oleg and Novgorod - Vladimir.</p>
<p>In this way, the order was confirmed princely rule, provided that the right to govern the whole territory of the Russian state representatives of a single dynasty - dynasty.</p>
<p>With minor modifications, this procedure lasted several centuries. He was not the kind of original invention Svyatoslav - so did everywhere in medieval Europe.</p>
<p>Sons Sviatoslav not escape mizhknyazivski strife. According to the Chronicle, the struggle for power between Yaropolk and Oleg lasted five years, sometimes zahostryuyuchys to war, that it is, after all, both left head.</p>
<p>In the midst of the events involved and the youngest son of Sviatoslav - Vladimir. It was he who after death Yaropolk established in Kyiv.</p>
