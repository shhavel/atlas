<p>Mechanical engineering plays a role in modern terms the basic complex around which formed the rational structure of the economy of the entire country. The state of the industry depends on logistical support and progress of all sectors and levels of life.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the map, engineering centers are located in the territory of Ukraine quite evenly, although almost half of the volume of output, number of employees, value of industrial fixed assets accounted for three engineering districts of Kharkov, Donbass, Pridneprovsky.</p>
<p>Metal-heavy engineering equipment manufactures machinery for mining, electric power, metallurgy, construction. It tends to raw materials (metal) and consumer and therefore located in the Dnieper and Donets Basin (Dnipropetrovsk, Kramators'k, Gorlivka, Krivoy Rog, Donetsk, Kharkiv).</p>
<p>Is focused on human resources and a network of communications transport machinery located practically in most regions of Ukraine.</p>
<p>With ohlyaduna potential of our country some world avtohihantyrozmischuyut collecting their cars in Ukrainian enterprises. So chynok, automobiles in Ukraine is represented by a number of companies in different capacities: Lviv, Cherkasy, Boryspil (buses), Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv (trolley), Kharkiv, Lutsk, Uzhgorod, Cherkassy (cars), Kremenchug (freight cars), t Frankincense Good Friday area (firefighting car). To this list should be added to companies that produce components and assemblies for cars (Melitopol, Kherson, Kharkiv).</p>
<p>Shipbuilding: Nikolaev (tankers), Kherson (sea and river vessels), Kyiv, Kerch, Feodosia.</p>
<p>Aircraft and production space technology developed in cities with high scientific and technical potential and highly qualified personnel (Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia). Locomotive Engineering: Luhansk, Kharkiv.</p>
<p>Enterprises car building located in Kremenchug, Dniprodzerzhyns'k Mariupol, closer to the centers of industry.</p>
<p>Is focused mainly on consumer agricultural machinery presented in Ternopil, Odessa, Kherson, Kharkiv, White Church.</p>
<p>Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kharkiv enterprises have machine tools and precision engineering that tend to qualified personnel.</p>
<p>Partial list would be no businesses operating on the needs of the military industrial complex (in Kharkiv and Kyiv produce and upgrade tanks, armored personnel carriers and other special).</p>
<p>In summary it can be stated: the industry has a high scientific potential, highly skilled workforce. Therefore, the development of engineering (especially high-tech) is one of the main priorities of the state. Further development of the industry requires technical re-equipment, reconstruction and modernization of production, including through the conversion of the former military-industrial complex.</p>
