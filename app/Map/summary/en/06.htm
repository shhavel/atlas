<p>The word "globe" in Latin means "ball". Globe is a model that reduced many times, a copy of the Earth, so it is in general keeps its shape. On the map of all the continents, oceans, seas are shown in full compliance with their position on the globe, the scale is the same for the whole surface of the globe, and distortion is minimal compared to the map. Distance can be measured on the globe thread or flexible ruler, then use a scale to determine the actual distance on the ground between the objects.</p>
<p>If the globe most accurately conveys the shape of our planet, whether it takes into account its flattening, it is well known that the Earth is not a perfect ball? The answer to this question can be found by taking a rather large globe, whose diameter is more than 60 cm (scale 1:20 000 000). Difference between polar and equatorial radius is expressed in thousandths of a millimeter fate. It is clear that the scale of this flattening of the globe will be invisible and will not affect the accuracy of the image of the continents and oceans. The relief of the earth's surface on this scale will not be visible, as well as the world's highest peak - Mount Dzhomolun“ëma (Everest), look like a grain of sand, a height of about 0.5 mm. That's why the Earth looks like from space perfect ball.</p>
<p>For precise drawing objects on a globe or a map using a system of lines - meridians and parallels. Crossing between these lines form a grid. Since the meridians and parallels spend a certain number of degrees, the grid formed by them was called the degree.</p>
