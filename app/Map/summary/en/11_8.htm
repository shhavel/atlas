<p>Ukraine in terms of de-Stalinization (1953-1964 gg.)</p>
<p>Reign of Nikita Khrushchev in the Soviet Union there were attempts to reform all aspects of social life, from rehabilitation of political prisoners and renaming of cities, and ending restructuring of the economy and administrative system of the country. There were changes in the administrative-territorial structure of Ukraine. In January 1954 the southern part of the Kiev region highlighted in Cherkasy region, in February of that year eliminated the Izmail region, connecting it to Odessa. A February 19, 1954, in honor of the tercentenary of Pereyaslav Council, Ukraine officially annexed the Crimean region of the RSFSR. In this connection, by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was adopted a decree "On the transfer of the Crimean Oblast from the RSFSR to the USSR." It is presented as "evidence dating Russian people of Ukrainian". At first territorial acquisition has placed an additional burden on the Ukrainian economy, because after the deportation of the Crimean Tatars economy of the peninsula were not in the best condition. In addition, the Crimea dramatically increasing the proportion of Russians in the population of Ukraine. Instead, the Soviet leadership encouraged the Ukrainian leave the republic. The most noticeable outflow of Ukrainian population in eastern regions of the USSR took place in 1954-1956 gg., While pioneering. Administrative-territorial transformations were completed in May 1958 with the merger of Lviv and Drohobych regions. Since then has been almost 50 years of Ukraine's borders and boundaries of the regions are the same.</p>
<p>Measures have been taken to improve the efficiency of economic management by replacing centralized sectoral management of territorial. To that end, the Council of Ministers on 26 September 1957 in Ukraine was established 11 economic districts. All have acted Council of the economy (economic councils). According eliminated the federal and republican line ministries - their powers were transferred to the Economic Councils. Therefore, controls a large part of the economy focused on the ground. In 1960 with the current economic councils vyokremylysya three: Poltava and Crimea. The system radnarhospiv caused some inconvenience in the management industry not included from the beginning of reform. To fix them, formed the Ukrainian Council of the economy, and at the end of 1962 instead of the 14 economic administrative regions formed seven economic regions. But this reform has not produced the expected results, and management of the economy started to return to the old centralized scheme.</p>
<p>During the 1950s and early 1960s continued industrial growth in the country. In Donbass and Lviv-Volyn coal basin were introduced in place new mines. Along with the growth of oil production in old industrial areas Precarpathians were commissioned oil fields in eastern regions of Ukraine. In 1956, started operation Shebelynka natural gas deposits in Kharkiv.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s were built Kakhovska and Kremenchug hydroelectric power, but a side effect of increasing the energy potential of the republic was the flooding waters of the reservoirs fertile and densely populated land Dnieper.</p>
<p>Accelerated development industry gave the following results: 1951 - 1958 рр. Pig iron in Ukraine increased more than 2 times, and rolled steel - 2.5 times. Total production engineering and metal increased 3.4 times. Unfolded construction of chemical plants. It was assumed that maintaining such growth in industrial production, the Soviet Union in the short term "create a material and technical base of communism" overtake and surpass most developed countries. However, a return to the administrative-command system of the Soviet economy rozvertalo on extensive road management, and in the future lead to stagnation.</p>
