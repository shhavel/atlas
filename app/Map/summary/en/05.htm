<p>To determine the demographic policy in the region is important to take into account trends in changes in the composition and population, as well as observations on the factors that influence demographic trends, including fertility and mortality, shlyubnist, reproducibility of population migration.</p>
<p>The evolution of natural population growth indicates a slowdown in the process of depopulation regions of the state, draws a colorful picture of the demographic crisis in Ukraine's regions at a rate of natural increase, which in all regions except the Transcarpathian region is negative. The reasons for this - poor economic situation, complications environmental situation (especially - after the accident), changing the mentality of women (many of them focusing on their own careers, in no hurry to have children).</p>
<p>The components of natural population growth is fertility and mortality. With maps Fertility population shows that the rate (per 1000 inhabitants) has a general tendency to increase from east to west, due to a tradition of marriage and family inherent to population in different regions of Ukraine. In particular, large families are more common in the western regions of Ukraine (especially rural areas).</p>
<p>Mortality rates have the opposite trend. Increasing it from west to east and north due to the fact that the East is concentrated the largest number of industrial enterprises, which stops by the economic crisis hit the most painful inhabitants of these regions. In addition, there is very intense environmental situation, together with the general aging of the population also have an impact on mortality.</p>
<p>From 1991 to 2006 in the Ukraine population growth changed from 39.1 thousand. To -297.7 thousand. People a year. This was due to a significant reduction in fertility and increased mortality.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in recent years some improvement in the economic situation and the leadership of the country introduced measures to stimulate the birth rate had a positive effect on the rates of natural population movement. Depopulation slowed, and in some areas due to increase in fertility for the first time in 10 years of natural growth rates became positive values. But population decline in Ukraine continues.</p>
<p>Improving quality of life will not only curb the process of depopulation, but also reduce the exodus abroad because migration processes in Ukraine reinforce the process of reducing the population. Interregional migration affect their balance in the region and interstate - the total population in Ukraine. In 2006 in most regions there was a positive balance of international migration, the bulk of which were migrants from CIS countries. In interregional migration largest migration gain was observed in Kyiv, Kharkiv region, Sevastopol. The biggest negative indicators were in the Luhansk, Kirovohrad region.</p>
