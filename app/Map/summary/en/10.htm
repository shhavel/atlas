<p>After the defeat of Denikin's war with Soviet Russia, according to the Polish leadership was inevitable. Attempts to normalize relations RSFRR unsuccessful. April 25, 1920 Polish troops launched an offensive on Soviet territory. The cause of the war have great aspiration of Poland, which wanted to restore the Commonwealth in its borders "from sea to sea," ie, from the Baltic to the Black Sea. This state should have included Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Invading Polish forces was followed by the signing of the UPR and Poland, 21 -24 April 1920 three conventions, which are called "Warsaw agreement." The Polish government recognized the right of the UPR independent existence, and Singapore and Chief Petliura recognized by the highest authorities in Ukraine. Instead, Western Ukraine with a population of 5.2 million people had to remain within Poland. UNR troops with Polish troops were to take part in the Soviet-Polish campaign, which resulted in expected to resume sovereignty over UNR Bolsheviks captured areas of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The first stage of the Soviet-Polish war (April - May 1920) was held successfully in Poland, whose troops to May 7 along with the UPR and UGA teams took Zhitomir, Vinnitsa, Kyiv and other cities. With the triple advantage against Soviet divisions of the Southwestern Front, the Poles hoped and anti-Bolshevik uprising in the rear of the Soviet troops.</p>
<p>However, the Polish occupation regime immediately aroused dissatisfaction. In Poland exported industrial equipment, goods and raw materials, and most importantly - Updating landlordism. Return landowners and land estates accompanied by repression of the Ukrainian population and caused a surge of peasant uprisings.</p>
<p>In mid-May 1920 the situation in the Polish-Soviet front changed in favor of the Soviet side. To fight the Poles, the Soviet command moved the most combat-ready divisions. The plan involved the counterattack of the main blow in Belarus by the Western Front (commanded by Mikhail Tukhachevsky) towards Warsaw and auxiliary forces of the Southwestern Front (commanded by Alexander Yegorov) at-Brest. The counter-offensive of the Western Front, which began May 14, failed. May 26 launched an offensive in South-Western Front. June 5, 1 st Cavalry Army C. Budennogo broke the Polish defenses, June 7, took the red Zhitomir and Berdichev, June 12, came to Kyiv. By the end of June, military operations were transferred to the territory of Western Ukraine.</p>
<p>July 4, 1920 began a new offensive Western Front. In late July the Red Army entered the territory of Poland. These developments troubled governments of the Entente. July 22, 1920, the Polish government proposed to Moscow to begin negotiations. The Red Army stopped the attack. Now it hopes the Bolsheviks moved the world revolution, as evidenced by a Polish revolutionary committee headed by Yu and F. Dzerzhinsky Marhlevskym. Soviet troops were on pistupah to Warsaw.</p>
<p>But the Soviet command overestimated their capabilities. Back areas of the Red Army did not succeed in advanced parts; two Soviet fronts advancing in different directions (east - in Warsaw, Southwest - the Lions) Soviet attack did not lead to increased class conflicts, but rather consolidated Poles France has provided substantial assistance to Poland ammunition and equipment.</p>
<p>August 27, 1920 Polish troops from the region of Lublin attacked the flank of the Western Front, putting it on the brink of total defeat. There was a general retreat of Soviet troops. Front stabilized in Ukraine in line Korosten - Zhitomir - Berdichev. Both sides were bleeding. October 12, 1920 in Riga armistice was signed between Poland and Soviet Russia. It meant a break from Poland UPR.</p>
<p>Ukrainian troops, whose number grew to 35 million. People continued to fight on their own. But the forces were unequal. In November 1920, Soviet troops drove part Petliura p. Zbruch latter were forced to cross the occupied Polish territory. It Ukrainian troops were interned.</p>
<p>March 18, 1921 between Poland and Soviet Russia, signed the Peace of Riga. By signing the peace has been a delegation of USSR. Poland recognized the existence of the Ukrainian SSR. Kholmshchyna went to Poland, Podlasie, Western and Western Volhynia Polesie. Remained in Poland and eastern Galicia.</p>
<p>Thus, the Peace of Riga had to Ukraine even more severe consequences than the Warsaw Pact. Organized regular Ukrainian troops fighting for an independent Ukraine ended in their defeat. Ukraine was once again divided between neighboring countries: Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Soviet Russia. This status Ukraine, one of which was under foreign occupation, and the other established anti-national totalitarian regime, recognized by the international community and continued until World War II.</p>
<p>In early 1920 Entente ships evacuated to the Crimea remains of Denikin. Crimean group headed Whites Cossack Corps commander, Baron Wrangel. Pereformuvavshy troops, and making changes in the White movement, he launched the attack. At the end of June 1920, using the fact that the main forces of the Red Army were engaged in war with Poland and Wrangel conquered Northern Tavria, southern Katerinoslavshchina, creating a threat to the Donbass. All attempts to make a landing on the Taman peninsula and raise the Don and Kuban Cossacks in Bolshevist uprising failed. Soviet commanders, concerned about these developments, in August decided to create the Southern Front, headed by Mikhail Frunze. These were deployed additional forces, but they were enough to defeat Wrangel.</p>
<p>In order to raise additional forces in September between the Government of the USSR Makhno, the agreement on joint action against Wrangel. Makhno put forward political demands: give autonomy Guliaipolskiiy District, to allow propagation of anarchist ideas, release from prison and Makhno anarchists and help weapons. The Soviet leadership SSR after agreement with Moscow agreed to these demands. As a result of the transaction the Red Army got a well equipped mobile (major fighting force Makhno several thousand machine-gun tachanok) ally in the conquest of the Crimea.</p>
<p>August 7th Red Army went on the offensive. Location Kahovka she crossed the Dnieper and captured the base, which was a threat to the rear and side Wrangel's troops. All attempts to eliminate the springboard with no success. Unsuccessful raid ended Whites on the Right Bank and a breakthrough in the Donbass. In mid-October, the Whites kept the defense on all fronts. October 28 Red Army launched a decisive attack which culminated in utter defeat of Wrangel's army group in northern Taurus. White Guards lost 50% of manpower and 40% of the weapons. Driven in Crimea, they have posed a serious threat. Politburo of the Central Committee of the RCP (b) decided that all the winter to complete the defeat of Wrangel.</p>
<p>Red Army numbered some 100 thousand. Soldiers. She resisted 28000th group that defended Perekops'ko strong fortification on the Crimean isthmus. Command of the Red Army decided to attack through Siwash bypass fortifications and troops threw the Turkish assault on the shaft. Over 8 - November 11, 1920 the price of white defensive positions were taken significant losses. November 13th Red Army entered in Simferopol, Crimea, November 17 and all were in their hands.

<p>After the defeat of Wrangel Soviet command decided to finish with Makhno. November 20, were arrested and later executed by the commanders of the Crimean group Makhno army Karetnikov S. and P. Gavrylenko. November 25 began operations to destroy parts of Makhno in the Crimea. Near Evpatoria they were surrounded. But the easy victory failed. After a brutal battle units Makhno managed to escape from the Crimea, but when they Tymoshivka faced significant parts of the Red Army and defeated. Only a few managed to break Makhno, and then they are connected to the insurgency led by remnants of the MPRP, which burst from the environment around Huliaipole. To fight the rebels were thrown 2/3 of the Southern Front. Repression against the insurgents and the population that supported them, intensified insurgency. In March 1921, under the command of Makhno was already 15 thousand. People. In general, in Ukraine there were nearly 40 thousand. The rebels. The culmination of the anti-Bolshevik peasant movement was the summer 1921 to quell uprisings in Ukraine has focused almost 1 million Red Army. Finally, the insurgency through repression and the threat of famine began to subside. N. Makhno with a small group of supporters in September 1921 joined the Soviet-Romanian border, and then moved to France.</p>
<p>After the defeat of UNR troops to fight remnants of the Bolsheviks were interned by order of the Polish government in POW camps. Meanwhile in Ukraine unfolded massive peasant insurgency (Podolia, Kiev region, Ekaterinoslavschine, Poltava).
