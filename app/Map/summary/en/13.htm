<p>The slow horizontal movement of lithospheric plates called skladkoutvoryuyuchymy processes. Although the velocity of the lithospheric plates and small, a few centimeters per year, it significantly affects the formation of the relief of the planet. For example, thanks to the horizontal movement of lithospheric plates formed the highest mountain system of land Himalayas, the Andes, the Cordillera. For this reason, having the Carpathians and the Crimean Mountains.</p>
<p>There are 7 major plates and several smaller ones. The main are: African, Eurasian, Pacific, North American, South American, Indo-Australian and Nazca. To include small coconut, Caribbean, Filipino and Arabian plates. Some of the plates can move vertically. These movements are difficult to see because they take place over the centuries. They are called slow vertical movements.</p>
<p>In addition to the slow vertical movements in the areas of interaction of lithospheric plates occur and sudden fluctuations. On the surface they appear in the form of earthquakes, which often have considerable destructive power. Where there was a shift of masses of rocks, called the focus or hypocenter of the earthquake. As a result of the release of enormous energy arising waves called seismic. They extend in all directions from the cell and reach the surface. Place on surface above the focus is called the epicenter of the earthquake, the farther away it is, the weaker the force of the earthquake. The strength of an earthquake is measured on a scale from 1 (when the tremors can be fixed only by seismic instruments) to 12 (where, in addition to catastrophic destruction, there are also significant changes in the landscape).</p>
