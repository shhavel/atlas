<p>Power - an industry that involves the production of various types of power and its transportation lines to the consumer. The development of electricity depends primarily on the level of economic development, energy availability, quality, location, method of extraction. Total production and electricity consumption per capita is one of the key indicators of economic level of development of any country. So 3/4 of world electricity generation accounted for 10 countries: USA, Japan, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, France, the UK, Ukraine and India.</p>
<p>Most electricity in the world is produced by thermal power plants (TPP) - 60% using traditional fuels: coal, natural gas, fuel oil. Up to 20% of the world electricity generating hydroelectric power plant (HPP). In developing countries, a well-to hydropower, the figure is much higher: Norway (99%), Brazil (92%), Austria, Canada, Peru, New Zealand - more than 50%.</p>
<p>Nuclear power plants (NPP) provide 17% of global electricity production. These stations use the energy decay of radioactive isotopes of uranium or plutonium. Nuclear power reactors operating in 32 countries. The largest share of electricity generated at nuclear power plants - in France (76%), Belgium (61%), Germany, Ukraine (50%).</p>
<p>Only 1% of world electricity generating plants that use non-traditional (alternative) energy sources: solar, wind, tidal, wave energy, bioenergy, geothermal energy. Most of them geothermal power plants that use the internal heat of the Earth (Column chart, and comments submitted on the map Fossil Fuels).</p>
