<p>Fuel industry combines production, engaged in the extraction and processing of mineral fuels.</p>
<p>The heat of combustion of different fuels varies. The highest calorific value with oil and gas. But the value of consumption depends not only on its calorific value, but also on its capabilities, costs of production, transportation and more. Because oil and gas can be considered the most economic energy (production and transportation pipelines is relatively cheap). But Ukraine subsoil little on these resources. In 2006, oil and gas production in the Dnieper-Donets, the Black Sea-Crimean and Carpathian regions of oil and gas is 4.6 million tons of oil and to 21.1 billion m3 of gas, which is only 15-20% cover the needs of the state. The rest of Ukraine imports from Russia (oil and gas) and Turkmenistan (gas). However, our country has a prospective oil and gas areas in the Black Sea and in the deep layers of the Carpathian region, whose development in the future significantly weaken the state's energy dependence on Russia.</p>
<p>Powerful oil-refining industry of Ukraine, represented by plants in Lysychansk, Kremenchug, Drohobych Nadvornaya, Kherson, Odessa, provides not only the needs of the state in gasoline and diesel fuel, but also makes it possible to export light oil.</p>
<p>Leading among fuels holds coal reserves are concentrated in the Donbass and Lviv-Volyn basin and lignite Dnieper basin. Donetsk coal has a high cost, due to a large depth and small capacity reservoirs. Lignite is mined mainly Dnieper basin less expensive open (career) method, but it has a much lower calorific value. Coal Lviv-Volyn basin negligible, are mainly regional importance. Overall, the total fuel production countries the share of coal is about 70%.</p>
<p>The deposits of peat, focus on Polisskiy lowland, and because of its low calorie content used more as a chemical raw material and fertilizer than as fuel.</p>
<p>The problem of fuel dependence for any country is important. In our country it is particularly painful because of the structure of the economy and a large industrial capacity. Solving it is in several ways: diversification of energy supply sources, search and development of new deposits of its own, the introduction of modern energy technologies. At the same time, the formation of a modern transport infrastructure (pipelines, oil terminals in ports, tanker fleet) in combination with an advantageous geographical location give Ukraine an opportunity not only to improve their provision of fuel, but also increase revenue for transportation of raw materials to other countries.</p>
