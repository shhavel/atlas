<p>Map gives a clear picture of the dynamics of complex transformation processes of recent years in the economy. The rapid decline in production in virtually all industries (1990-1995 gg.) Later slowed down and turned into a stage of gradual growth. In addition, over the years, the structure of industry. The growth of the steel industry is due to the favorable situation on the world markets - industry provides the bulk of foreign exchange revenues. The growth of the food industry - proof that the industry gets weight, especially in the domestic market. Reducing the share of light industry reflects its dependence on imported raw materials - and this is the main cause of the current situation of the industry.</p>
<p>Industrial centers on the map using charts are organized by number of employees, the colors reflect the industrial structure of sectors centers. Most of the industrial centers concentrated in the Donbas and Precarpathians. Strong diversified industrial centers are Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kharkiv. Industry cities such as Sverdlovsk, Krasnodon Juzhnoukrainsk, etc. Enerhodar represented 1-3 branches.</p>
<p>Territorial analysis identifies regional differences in industrial specialization: fuel - in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions and in the north of Lviv region; steel - in Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions; engineering centers provided various capacities in many regions of Ukraine; Forest and wood - in the Carpathians and in Polesie; Food and light - all over Ukraine, and most of all - in Zhytomyr, Rivne, Ternopil, Khmelnitsky and Vinnitsa regions.</p>
<p>Indicators of the region's share in industrial production in Ukraine is a clear proof that the bulk of the industrial potential of Ukraine is concentrated in the eastern provinces.</p>
<p>Overall, Ukraine - a country with a large technical potential. Space technology, aircraft, equipment for nuclear power plants - are just some examples of high-tech products, known in many countries. After a decade of economic stagnation Ukraine at the beginning of. began to "come alive", demonstrating notable success. In 2004 GDP growth in this country exceeded 12% and, although in later years this figure has dropped slightly, though Ukraine has entered the path of sustainable economic growth.</p>
