He led the regiment administration asserted court orders, gave settlers free land, and commanded the regiment during the campaign.</p>
<p>Colonels elected for life. In addition, the Sloboda Ukraine often happened inheriting the position of colonel. This was due to the peculiarities of the settlement of new lands, colonels were usually leaders resettlement groups. They were a great authority because the founders were actually bands, unlike the Hetman.</p>

<p>The size of the Cossack regiments was not permanent.</p>
<p>List of all regiments contained a list of Sloboda Cossacks who had to perform military service.</p>
<p><b>Social conditions</b></p>
<p>After the National Liberation War of Ukrainian society has undergone great changes.</p>
<p><b>The Cossacks</b></p>
<p>The number of Cossacks grew, it became a privileged class.</p>
<p>Cossacks were recorded by name in government registries and subject only to the power of the Hetman, and elders.</p>
<p>They were given the right to freedom of living in cities and villages, craft classes, trade, fishing.</p>
<p>Preserved traditional Cossack court.</p>
<p>Cossacks were exempted from taxes, their main duty was military service.</p>
<p>Cossacks was the leading state and Sloboda Ukraine.</p>
<p>Cossacks owned land and worked on it in his own house, free to trade without paying taxes.</p>
<p>Just as in the Hetmanate, was their main conscription military service.</p>
<p>Largest group were policemen Cossacks - so called Cossacks, who lived in cities, towns, villages, hamlets Hetmanate and Sloboda Ukraine, unlike the grassroots (Zaporozhian) Cossacks.</p>
<p>In the second half of the XVII century. from among the Cossacks vyokremylas Cossack officers who occupied a dominant place in society.</p>
<p><b>Ukrainian gentry</b></p>
<p>Remained in the Hetmanate. It is increasingly merged with Cossack leaders due to receive petty rights and privileges.</p>
<p><b>Farmers</b></p>
<p>Numerous part Hetman. After the National Liberation War changed their position. They won the right to change their place of residence freely enter the Cossack state (only obstacle was the property status for military service took place at their own expense).</p>
<p>Personal freedom is kept farmers and Sloboda Ukraine. Their difference from the Cossacks was that they had to pay taxes to the royal treasury.</p>
<p><b>Burghers</b></p>
<p>Their situation in the second half of the XVII century. have changed.</p>
<p>It was determined by royal charter and norms Magdeburg rights.</p>
<p>Some urban residents pokozachylasya (60-80%). In contrast to the state of the middle class recorded some farmers.</p>
<p>Burghers were given free to own land; they are not limited to crafts, crafts and trade.</p>
<p>They pay taxes and fulfill obligations to the state, which, however, were much smaller than the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Many townspeople were among migrants to Sloboda Ukraine. They, like farmers, more than living with agriculture, but avoided and crafts, introducing the guild system, similar to that which existed in the Hetmanate.</p>
<p><b>Clergy</b></p>
<p>Privileged classes Hetmanate and Sloboda Ukraine.</p>
<p>His position was determined that Orthodoxy had the status of a state religion.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Church Hetman government placed a very important task - to be ideological support independent Cossack state.</p>
<p>It is no accident all helped hetmans church: whether financially supporting the monasteries, or caring about improving the education of priests and facilitating the printing of religious books.</p>
<p><b>Subordination UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX Church of Moscow Patriarchate</b></p>
<p>Implementation of the Orthodox Church as the core of the Ukrainian state worried Russian Tsarism, which sought the complete subjugation of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Royal officials believed that Orthodoxy in Ukraine has to justify their aggressive policy on Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the availability of independent Kiev Metropolis contrary to those beliefs.</p>
<p>Therefore, Moscow made an effort to be bound Ukrainian Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>After the death of Metropolitan Joseph Nelyubovych-Tukals'kyy (1675) through the intervention of Moscow long postponed elections in metropolitan department.</p>
<p>The tsarist government sought to use the situation to achieve his goal: to bring Kiev from the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Patriarch of Constantinople, setting her supremacy over the Patriarch of Moscow.</p>
<p>The subordination Ukrainian Orthodox Church could settle faster if this sympathetic Kyiv Metropolitan. That is why the metropolitan department searched the applicant, favorable Moscow. Finally found a (who was bishop of Lutsk Gideon Chetvertinsky), and June 19, 1684 was going to council.</p>
<p>With the support of Moscow Bishop Gideon was elected Metropolitan. In October of the same year, the newly elected Metropolitan went to Moscow, where Patriarch Joachim December 8, 1685 at the Assumption Cathedral was solemnly consecrated it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moscow's diplomacy sought influence over the Patriarch of Constantinople to the one agreed to shift the Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate.</p>
<p>In May 1686 the Patriarch of Constantinople under pressure from the Turkish government agreed to a separation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Constantinople throne. Thus, despite the ecclesiastical laws of the Kyiv Metropolis was subordinated to the Patriarch of Moscow.</p>
<p>The subordination of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was a heavy defeat Ukrainian liberation struggle - because from 1686 the church no longer provided ideological support in the struggle for Ukraine's independence, and vice versa - has gradually become an obedient tool aggressive policies of kings, transformed into a means of Russification Ukrainian deprivation their national statehood ideas.</p>
