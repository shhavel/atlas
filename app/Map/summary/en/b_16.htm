<p>The main fuel resources in the world are oil, natural gas, coal and lignite. The total area of ​​coal basins and deposits reaches 15% of the Earth's land. Global coal resources are mainly concentrated in the northern hemisphere and form a huge pool area (title 10 largest pools of coal and lignite are subscribed to the map).</p>
<p>Oil and gas are produced in 80 countries. But it is in the countries of the Middle East are more than half the world's proven oil reserves and a third of the world's gas reserves. Significant oil reserves are also in South America, Southeast Asia and North Africa. Among the largest reserves of natural gas to Russia, oil - Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Fossil Fuels, as well as other mineral resources are limited and non-renewable. With the current rate of use of their stocks run out quickly, so we need to find and use other unconventional energy resources. Now the world has used wind power, energy, tides, solar and geothermal energy. The map also presents information about the Earth's geothermal resources that have been explored in 50 countries. Especially significant they are in areas of high seismic and volcanic activity in the so-called geothermal zones. Geothermal containing dry steam is used for the construction of geothermal power plants. First GeoTES were built in Italy. Now they are in the US, Mexico, Japan, Russia, Canada, Switzerland, New Zealand. In the US, California is the world's most powerful GeoTES Geysers. Much more widely used to warm the Earth's interior heat. Thus, the capital of Iceland, Reykjavik, from 1930, uses geothermal heat in heating systems.
