<p><b>Knowledge Universe</b></p>
<p>In ancient times, people did not have sufficient knowledge about how equipped the world. Because different people in their own imagined the Earth and the universe. Thus, the ancient Indians imagined the Earth as a hemisphere, lying on the backs of four elephants standing on a giant turtle. The inhabitants of Babylon imagined the Earth as a hill on the western slope of which is Babylonia. Residents of Ocean coast imagined the Earth as a disc that resembles a shield warrior. This disc is placed on the backs of three whales that swim boundless ocean. The Greek philosopher Thales imagined universe in the form of liquid mass, which is located inside a large bubble in the shape of hemisphere. The philosopher Anaximander imagined the Earth segment column or cylinder, one of the foundations which we live. Anaximander believed that the Earth - the center of the universe. Only in the early 16th century, when people began to make long trips, swimming through Ferdinand Magellan was proved sphericity of the Earth's shape.</p>
<p>Greek scholar Aristotle first used to prove the sphericity of the Earth Observation lunar eclipse, he noticed that the shadow of the Earth falls on the full moon is always round. During eclipses the Earth to the Moon is facing various parties.</p>
<p>But a bullet is always formed round shadow. Finally, the astronomer Aristarchus of Samos suggested that the Sun is not at the planets moving around the Earth, and the Earth and all the planets revolve around the sun.</p>
<p>In the future to monitor the outside world began to use different devices. Telescope, for example, through a magnifying lens, which it hosted, gives an opportunity to bring the celestial bodies and make out details that are not visible to the naked eye. For the first time used a telescope, Galileo Galilei. There are optical telescopes, radio telescopes and space telescopes (those installed on the aircraft).</p>
<p>Today technological progress for research enables the use of very sophisticated and effective devices. The actual breakthrough in the study of the universe occurred when the person was able to run into space aircraft. To study the Earth from space and exploring other celestial bodies used by spacecraft, satellites, spaceships, space stations. Among the distinguished unmanned spacecraft (controlled from Earth) and those operated by astronauts member crew.</p>
