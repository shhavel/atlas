<p>The first major territorial domain administration Jefferson bought Louisiana became just $ 15 million in France in 1803</p>
<p>Consequently, the US territory doubled. Further acquisition of territories by the end of the XIX century. formed throughout the country. This, in general, it remains to this day.</p>
<p>Along with the increase in area is rapidly growing population. In 1800 it was 5.3 million in 1820 - 9.6 in 1840 - 17, and in 1860 - 31.5 million people. In fact, every ten years the population of the United States increased by one third. This was, above all, due to ever-increasing immigration.</p>
<p>At the same time dramatically decreased the indigenous population of the continent - the Indians. The level of development they significantly inferior to Europeans failed to protect their land. At the time of the discovery of America by Columbus inhabited the territory of modern US 10-12 million Indians, and at the end of XIX century. they were only 200 thousand.</p>
<p>Due to lack of manpower in the continent of America, from the XVII century., Imported black slaves. During the first half of XIX century. Their number is constantly increasing: from 1.19 million people in 1810 to 4 million in 1860</p>

However, the leadership of the country was in the hands of the southern states. Complicated situation and that slaveholders of the South tried to extend the plantation system of management to new lands of the West, where between opponents and supporters of slavery there were sometimes fighting.</p>
<p>Political leaders of the North favored the elimination of slavery throughout the country. Southern planters saw in those plans a threat to their way of life. Many of them advocated for secession from the United States and establish their own state. After winning the presidential election of 1860 Republican Abraham Lincoln, who was the strongest opponent of slavery, the planters of the South moved to act decisively.</p>
<p>The first withdrawal from the US in December 1860 stated, South Carolina, and in February 1861 11 southern states announced the creation of a new state-of Confederation of American States. April 12, 1861 its forces captured Fort Sumter, where he allied garrison. The US Civil War began.</p>

More and more South unaochnyuvalasya failure to conduct such a war. Simultaneously, the economy of the North during the war successfully developed and flourished.</p>
<p>Important for the course of hostilities had two political steps taken by the US administration. In May 1862 the US Congress passed a law under which any American who has attained the age of 21 can get a piece of land in the West and become a farmer. January 1, 1865, President Lincoln signed a proclamation that declared the slaves free. Since then, the civil war was not a struggle with the rebellious states, but also against slavery.</p>
<p>In 1863 there was a turning point in the war in favor of the North. Confederate troops under General Robert E. Lee, feeling the lack of people, ammunition and equipment, with heavy losses retreated under the onslaught of the Allied armies, led by General Ulysses grant. Remains of Confederate armies were surrounded near the village of Appomattox, April 9 where Grant and Lee signed the surrender of the main army of the South. By the end of June, laid down their arms and other Confederate forces. The civil war ended with the victory of the North.</p>
