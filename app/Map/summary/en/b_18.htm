<p>Land - land is used or could be used in human activities. Of the 149.4 million square meters. km land surface 134 million km square. is its land fund. Chart presented to map the structure of the land fund and its distribution in different regions of the world.</p>
<p>The greatest pressure affects agricultural land and land settlements. Agricultural land is the most productive and arable land (arable land) is part of the land fund, from which humanity gets to 80% of food products. Of arable land in parts of the world is very uneven. It depends on the environmental conditions and the level of agricultural development in culture management. Among the regions of the world highest percentage of arable land allocated Europe. This is due to the lowest share of unusable land management and high culture largely favorable climate and topography. With some of the world's most arable lands are USA, India, China, Canada, Kazakhstan, Ukraine. Each year the area of ​​agricultural land decreases. The reason for this is open mining, flooding of land newly created reservoirs, low culture of management (and as a result - land degradation and desertification them). During the degradation of farmland scientists understand the depletion of land, reducing soil fertility and soil erosion, pollution, reducing the biological productivity of natural pastures, salinization and waterlogging of irrigated areas. At the same time, population growth and decline zemlezabezpechenosti exacerbate the issue of increasing agricultural land and more efficient use of arable land.
