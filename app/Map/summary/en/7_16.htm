<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. Get an independent principality</b></p>
<p>Formation of the lands, principalities in the Western territory was gradually.</p>
<p>On the one hand, his circumstances have shaped pretty good development Galician and Volyn territories yet to princely times, but on the other - and the role that was played by Galicia and Volhynia as the western border ownership Kievan princes.</p>
<p>Its name is due to Volyn ancient tribal center of Volyn. However, it is not destined to become the capital city of Volyn principality.</p>
<p>Such fame earned Vladimir - bridge, built by Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich to mark the accession of Volyn lands in Kyiv.</p>
<p>In the next century Volhynia remained the possession of the Kievan princes and hereditary paternal turned just a grandson of Vladimir Monomakh - Iziaslav Mstislavovitch.</p>
<p>So, own princely dynasty began to emerge there in the mid-12th century.</p>
<p>Then Volyn plunged into internal strife, resulting in a split into several portions.</p>
<p>Galicia from the start of its accession to the Kievan Rus observed greater independence from Kyiv.</p>
<p>Name of the Galician land so transparently linked to the town Galich - old cell, from the mid 12th century. became the capital of the principality.</p>
<p>The founders of the dynasty of Galician princes were Rostislavich - descendants grandson of Yaroslav the Wise.</p>
<p>Knyazyuyuchy, they had to take into account the extremely influential Galician nobility.</p>
<p>In Galicia aristocracy formed mostly from local tribal leaders, who are not getting their estates of the prince, and the appropriation of public lands, and it was independent of the princes.</p>
<p>This fact greatly influenced the political life of the Galician principality.</p>
<p><b>2. Highlights of the history of Galician principality</b></p>
<p>The first ruler of the Galician land Rostislav had three sons - Rurik, Lord and Vasylko that got in the possession of Przemysl, Zvenigorod and Terebovlya.</p>
<p>The brothers have made great efforts to secure the right to paternal Galician land.</p>
<p>The complexity of the situation due to the fact that their father was deprived, resentful prince.</p>
<p>Three Yaroslavichy - Iziaslav, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod did not consider it equal to themselves and forced into exile.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, Rostislav had to fight against relatives.</p>
<p>The victim of infighting after Lyubech Congress Duke was, as you recall, Cornflower Terebovlia.</p>
<p>Yea, and dearly, Rostislavich still won the right to Galicia.</p>
<p>However, for the time being redistributed edge remained for several principalities: Przemysl, Galician, Terebovlyansky and Zvenigorod land.</p>
<p>Unite the land under the sole authority of Galicia turned to his son Lord Volodymyrko doable.</p>
<p>Year 1141 he moved his residence to Galich, confirming the intention is solely to rule in the United Galician principality.</p>
<p>Even more successful, but it was far from challenging the reign of his son Vladimirka Volodarevych - Yaroslav.</p>
<p>Among the main achievements of Yaroslav Osmomysl scientists call</p>
<ul>
<li>extending the Galician principality up to the mouth of the Dniester,</li>
<li>prudent far-sighted foreign policy: good relations with Hungary, Poland and Byzantium, on the one hand,</li>
<li>and most influential Rus princes - on the other, ensuring peace Galician land and contributed to economic development.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest hassle Galician prince remained his own nobles.</p>
<p>Indomitable will Galician nobility he first felt, just took Galician table. Then, in 1153, nobles, uncertain political calculations of the young prince, did not allow him to lead the Galician wife during the battle against troops of the prince of Kiev.</p>
<p>And no matter how offensive to the prince-warrior was suspension from participation in the battle, it is threatened less trouble than the events of 1159</p>
<p>At the time of the Galician boyars decided to change the prince invited to Galich Yaroslav's cousin John Berladnyka - Prince without possessions, which for many years vainly fought for their share in the royal heritage.</p>
<p>But Jaroslav happily came out of that situation; power Galician prince rose and seemed in no way is no longer dependent on the whims of knights.</p>
<p>And when in 1170, the nobles interfered with privacy Yaroslav revealed that overcome the tyranny of the boyars in the Galician principality he still could not.</p>
<p>Galicia, according to the researchers, there was a kind of political structure. It is considered a model of oligarchic rule.</p>
<p>Actually, this explains that after the death of Yaroslav Osmomysl Galicia once again plunged into a whirlpool of strife and discord - especially violent after the death of Yaroslav's son Vladimir (1199).</p>
<p>Vladimir of Novgorod was the last representative of the dynasty Rostislav on Galician table.</p>
<p><b>3. Political life Volynprincipality</b></p>
<p>At the end of the 12th century. Volyn was redistributed among the descendants Iziaslav Mstislavovitch - founder of the dynasty Volyn prince, a few portions.</p>
<p>The most honorable considered Vladimir and Volyn land.</p>
<p>Beside them, the feudal princes in some years had Belz, June, Brest, Peresopnytsya, Dorohychyn.</p>
<p>However, the feud did not last long.</p>
<p>Land they put the son of Mstislav II of Kiev Roman.</p>
<p>He came to Volhynia just received the news of his father's death.</p>
<p>As the eldest of the brothers took Vladimir table and gradually began to make unifying policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, very few sources inform about the activities of Roman Mstyslavych.</p>
<p>From the evidence of alien learn that the Duke was active in antypolovetskiy fight.</p>
<p>By active was his policy and in the west, including the tribes Yatvingians.</p>
<p>Had a close relationship with Poland and Byzantium.</p>
<p><b>On the huge state-Roman experience is evidenced by the fact that he instantly took advantage of the death of Prince Vladimir Galician and in 1199 annexed Galicia to their possessions.</b></p>
<p><b>4. Formation of Galicia-Volyn principality</b></p>
<p>Consequently, the year 1199 began a new chapter not only in the lives of Volyn prince - in memory of posterity Autocrat of all Russia, but also in the history of Ukrainian lands. For those researchers indicate the year of birth of the Galicia-Volyn principality.</p>
<p>The capital of the united principalities Roman chose Galich, considering it the most important task to overcome the resistance Galician nobility.</p>
<p>By Roman Mstyslavych plans were also extend the authority for the remainder of Ukrainian lands.</p>
<p>Year 1202 he had a fight with the prince of Kiev Rurik Rostislavich, as a result of which the latter denied Kiev table.</p>
<p>Not intending himself to reign in Kiev, Roman sat there, under the assumption of some researchers, a close Igor Yaroslav, according to others - a governor.</p>
<p>However, the real ruler of Kiev and Pereyaslav principality subordinate was Galician-Volyn prince.</p>
<p>Tu his power confirmed by numerous campaigns against the Polovtsian organized for the protection of Pereyaslav and the Kiev region.</p>
<p>Among the reasons are called Roman to Galich, researchers have called not only uncertainty Prince of Galician nobles.</p>
<p>Many weighed for Roman Mstyslavych participation in European events. So he took an active part in the internecine struggle Polish princes, and in 1205 was involved, as suggested by historians, in opposition to the German Hohenstaufen dynasty and the House of Welf.</p>
<p>With its commitment to Hohenstaufen, Galicia-Volyn holder out march through Poland to Saxony.</p>
<p>However, his former allies prevented advancement - Polish princes Lesco White and Conrad. In the battle of the Vistula Zawichost on June 19, 1205 Roman died.</p>
<p>Create Galicia-Volyn principality headed by the "autocrat of all Russia" Roman the Great was an important milestone in the history of Ukrainian state, as opposed to multi-ethnic Kievan state of Galicia-Volyn Ukrainian based on a single basis. This gave grounds Ukrainian historians call the novel "the creator of the first national Ukrainian state," that as a separate political body lasted until the late 14th century.</p>
<p><b>5. The situation of Galicia-Volyn principality after the death of Roman Mstyslavych</b></p>

<p>However, although conflicting interests were parties to the conflict, they had something in common - a reluctance to return to Galicia-Volhynia Romance descendants. It had to deal with Daniel and Vasya.</p>

<p>Return of legal rights for Romanovychi began with formal consolidation Vasylko in Brest.</p>
<p>Not wanting to obey the prince of Belz, bark turned to the King of Poland, which was under pryhystom Anna with his youngest son, he allowed the prince to return to Volhynia.</p>
