<p>Map of "Education and Science" gives an idea of ​​the costs of education in the countries of the world (as a percentage of GNP), and the percentage of pupils and students in the population of individual countries. It is indicative of the people with higher (university) education. In industrialized countries, the figure is an average of 19%, and in developing countries - 1%. In industrialized countries, a thousand residents have an average of 85 scientists and technicians in Sweden - 262, and in developing countries, only 9.</p>
<p>High level of education of the population determines the potential of the country in the development of knowledge-intensive production, which in turn determine the place of the state in the international division of labor. So, for example, Brazil, in terms of growth the number of students is one of the first places among the developing countries. Scientific and technical potential of the country is increasing. Now Brazil exports its technology abroad, provides technical and advisory services to many other countries.</p>
<p>The scope of research and the publication of research and design institutions affect the territorial structure of the economy of countries and regions. Over the last decade there was a network of cities for which research and development are the main function, the so-called science and technology and research parks, innovation centers, techno. Science parks - is located on the territory of university complexes having the conditions for the development of research and development of advanced technologies, combined laboratory and research groups of universities and industrial companies specializing in high-tech industries. An example of science parks is Technopolis Sofia in France, Oxford in the UK, Berkeley, Oakland in the US.</p>
<p>Technopolis in many countries have become a kind of scientific growth poles which form large regional innovation systems, for example in the area of ​​Tsukuba Japan, Russia - Dubna, Silicon Valley in the United States, Cambridge Science Park, which originated around the UK's largest technopolis.</p>
