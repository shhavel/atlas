<p>Social and political life of Ukrainian lands in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>1. Masonic lodges and secret political groups</p>
<p>The French Revolution gave rise to fight people for social and political rights. The desire for change gripped almost all segments of society. Across Europe, formed various clubs, secret societies, which set out to make changes in the existing system. Actively formed liberal, conservative, socialist doctrine, there are political organizations, secret societies, Masonic lodges. They sought to change. Under the influence of these processes in Ukraine, too, are beginning to have a secret political society.</p>
<p>The immediate impetus for their formation were the sentiments that are imbued with Russian officers, nobles after the victory over Napoleon. After returning from victorious campaigns in Western Europe, they are very different eyes looked into Russian reality. The political regime of autocracy and feudal order strongly contrasted with the ideas, slogans that proclaimed the French Revolution: "Liberté, égalité, fraternité!"</p>
<p>Secret societies that arose in Ukraine, cleaned the form of fashion at the time of Masonic lodges. In the 1818-1819 biennium. These lodges emerged in Kiev ("United Slavs") and Poltava ("Love of Truth"), Odesa, Zhytomyr, Kamenetz-Podolsk. Among its members were known Ukrainian leaders John Kotljarevs'kyj, Kapnist Basil, Basil Lukashevich, and later the leaders of the Decembrist movement Pavel Pestel, Michael Orlov, Bestuzhev-Rumin. While these lodges were established in Ukraine, their activities had no Ukrainian national character. One of the goals that the organizers had set the first secret society in Ukraine, was to attract Ruthenian nobility to nationwide opposition movement. Ukrainian aristocratic Masons did not submit a specific national requirements. Another character had a lodge that operated in Right-Bank Ukraine. Their members were Polish gentry are not associated with the Russian Freemasonry. His main political objective of these lodges considered the restoration of the Polish state within the borders of 1772 many of the members of Masonic lodges in Ukraine included in the Decembrist organizations. Ukraine, along with St. Petersburg has become a major field of action of the Decembrists - only in these two centers Decembrist movement came to an open armed uprisings against autocracy.</p>
<p>In 1822 the royal government to ban the activities of lodges and their members are persecuted.</p>
<p>In the 20 years of the nineteenth century. in Ukraine there are secret political circles. One of the first was based group "Little Russian secret societies", chaired by V. Lukashevich. The program of the Company ("Catechism autonomists") proclaimed desire to achieve disconnect from Russia and Ukraine joining the reborn Poland.</p>
<p>At the end of 1820 at Kharkov University and Nezhinskaya school formed secret groups that spread banned literature, at its meetings criticized the existing system.</p>
<p>Unlike Livovoberezhnoyi Ukraine, on the Right Bank was not held for a long time measures that would set out to closer integration of this region into the Russian Empire. The imperial government tacitly acknowledged the orders that existed in the days of the Commonwealth in Right-Bank Ukraine, and left almost intact the rights and privileges of the local Polish nobility. Much of the right-bank Ukrainian gentry were descendants of families, spolyachenyh after the adoption of the Catholic faith in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They dreamed of restoring the borders of the Commonwealth in 1772 Therefore, in the first third of the XIX century. Right-Bank Ukraine was Polish thorns revitalization movement.</p>
<p>Polish uprising of 1830-1831. Autocracy was not supported by the population Ukrainian Right Bank. The uprising was suppressed. Cossack regiments formed to defeat the insurgents, was transformed into a regular army, while others moved to the Caucasus. The tsarist government closed the University of Vilna and Kremenetskiy Lyceum. In 1839 on the Right Bank was abolished ecclesiastical union, and all the Greek Catholic believers forcibly converted to Orthodoxy. The arrests were subjected to the Polish nobility.</p>
<p>Right-Bank Ukraine for 1830-1840 years was a battleground between the Russian and Polish influences. Both sides were agreed among themselves in denial right of the Ukrainian people to free self-development.</p>
<p>2. Decembrist movement in Ukraine</p>
<p>Losing hope of liberalizing autocracy, abolishing serfdom, increased reaction after the war of 1812-1814. Contributed to the growth in, and, accordingly, also in Ukraine opposition sentiment. The leading role in this movement played a noble revolutionary Decembrists. The Decembrists create secret political groups that aimed to primarily fight for the abolition of serfdom and autocracy elimination. For example, in 1816 in St. Petersburg was created "Union of Salvation" in 1818 - "Union of Welfare" in Moscow. They set the objective of constitutional representative government, eliminate the monarchy, abolish serfdom by a military coup. Members of the opposition-minded organizations were officers. In 1818 after the arrival of the service of the Kyiv General M. Orlov city became the center of business meetings of the "Union of Welfare."</p>
<p>In 1821 the Decembrists reorganized their union and created two centers - the center of the Northern Society in St. Petersburg and Southern Company with the center in the city. Tulchin. Chairman of the latter was elected Colonel P. Pestel, members of a society have become officers of regiments that were in Ukraine. Soon, other than Tulchin council was established two councils: Kamensky - led by David B. and S. Volkonski - and Brother, led by Lt. Col. S. Muravyov-Apostol. Occasionally there were conspiratorial meetings societies. For this purpose Fair. Although the meetings discussed issues of joint actions between these organizations was noticed a significant difference: Southern Company was more radical than the North, which was limited in its plan for the overthrow of absolutism and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Southern Society P. Pestel entered into a political treatise (Constitution) "Russkaya Pravda", detailing the program defined actions after the overthrow of the tsarist regime. Under this program all the peoples of Russia are united in a centralized republic with a unicameral legislature. Serfdom is abolished. All citizens of the Republic are equal before the law. Stored private ownership of land, but half the land is considered public, some parts can be taken for cultivation. Complete freedom of trade and industry.</p>
<p>In 1823 in Volynskyy, was founded by the third secret organization - the Society of United Slavs, whose founders were brothers Borisov. His democracy it differed from the Southern Society. In 1825 this company merged.</p>
<p>In December 1825, died in Taganrog Tsar Alexander I successor was his brother Constantine, but marriage to a Polish woman deprived of his rights to the throne. The second brother Nicholas initially refused the throne. Came "mizhtsaryuvannya." Northern Society decided to take advantage of this, and December 14, 1825 uprising in St. Petersburg. But it was not properly prepared. Soldiers regiments retired to the Senate Square, did not know the purpose of the uprising. The population did not support the action, and the king's troops easily dispersed the rebels. Arrests began.</p>
<p>Failure Petersburg uprising forced the leaders of the Southern Society accelerate the performance to which it also was not ready.</p>
<p>December 13 arrested P. Pestel. Leadership passed to S. Muraveva-Apostol, and 28 December he raised Chernigov Regiment. But we went to Kyiv and lost in vain for three days in search of allies. Meanwhile, the rebels went to meet government troops. Already in the first fight was heavily wounded commander of the regiment S. Muraveva-Apostol. 900 soldiers surrendered without a fight.</p>
<p>Leaders of the revolt was brought to St. Petersburg on the court. Five of them hanged: K. Ryleeva Kakhovsky M., S. Muraveva-Apostol, M. Bestuzhev-Rumin and P. Pestel. The Caucasus and Siberia exiled many officers. Soldiers punished rods and transferred to other regiments.</p>
<p>The reasons for the failure of the Decembrist uprising in Ukraine for many, the main thing was that his goal was confusing for people.</p>
<p>For future generations, the Decembrists were a model of courage, heroism, self-sacrifice and devotion to the revolutionary cause. Nobles by social origin, the Decembrists donated all the benefits of the class for the progress of society.</p>
<p>3. Polish uprising of 1830-1831.</p>
<p>In 1830 the Ukrainian lands found themselves in a whirlwind of events connected with the Polish national liberation uprising against Russian rule, which began in the Kingdom of Poland.</p>
<p>Created as a result of victory in Warsaw Uprising national government put forward a program of revival within the borders of the Commonwealth in 1772 at the Polish proposal to start negotiations Emperor Nicholas said that the rebels can handle only two of his proposals: surrender or destruction. Thus the Polish insurgents launched the famous slogan: "For our freedom and yours!" They hoped to unite in the struggle against imperial subjugation of opposition from the public Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian. On the Right Bank, they called landowners at least promise to give land to the peasants, to bring them to his side, but most of the Polish nobility rejected this proposal.</p>
<p>To help the rebels were troops of the Polish gentry of the Right Bank. Ukrainian peasantry believed their actions purely "lordly thing," and in order to convince him to join the Polish gentry, slogans alone was not enough.</p>
<p>The Russian government initially found himself in deep water, but quickly discovered a way out. In Chief of the Russian forces, Field Marshal F.Osten-Saken appealed to Ukrainian peasants Right Bank. "Do not believe them (ie Polish) - called it - and those who would persuade and compel an uproar, try to grab and dopravyty authorities. You never will belong to those landowners who stand up against legitimate authority. " The content of this proclamation, which was read in all churches of the Right Bank, the villagers understood as an opportunity to break free from the yoke of the manor. They gladly took the nobles, rebels and handed them to the Russian authorities. At the same time the imperial government decided, as in all previous battles, use military talents descendants of Ukrainian Cossacks. Appeared imperial decree on the formation of regiments of Cossacks in Little Chernihiv and Poltava provinces. Those wishing to sign up to them were many, as it was stated that they will forever be the Cossack service. For six weeks, Little Governor-General Nikolai Repnin (1778-1845) formed regiments of 8 1 thousand. Shower in each. However, in suppressing insurrection Cossack regiments take no time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russian troops in June 1831 suppressed the rebellious Polish nobility performances on the Right Bank, and in early September stormed Warsaw. Formed Cossack regiments were rozucheni. Polish nobility suffered repression.</p>
<p>4. Start the national revival in Dnieper Ukraine</p>
<p>Amid political movements that took place in the Ukrainian lands in the early nineteenth century. rapidly became the place a process known as Ukrainian national revival.</p>
<p>Modern historians distinguished in the development of national movements in Eastern Europe three stages, which can be called folk-ethnographic, cultural and political. In folklore-ethnographic stage small group of scientists in order to confirm the identity of its own people collected and studied historical documents, ethnographic artifacts, folklore attractions. The content of the cultural stage is to revive the language of the people, the struggle for the expansion of its use, especially in literature and education. The political stage is characterized by greater organizational mobilization of national power, the emergence and consolidation of their political organizations, the realization of national interests, active struggle for national liberation.</p>
<p>The elimination of the autonomous system of Sloboda Ukraine, Kharkiv, Getmanschina 60-80 years of the eighteenth century. caused protest among a large part of Cossack, whose rights to a noble title reluctantly acknowledged St. Petersburg. In addition, the Ukrainian nobility enjoyed wider privileges than the Russian nobles. Thus, the nobles were exempt from mandatory state and military service, their estates were not subject to civil forfeiture, they could be judged only like them. Defending their state rights and privileges, the nobility while defending the rights of independent Ukraine. Also autonomist sentiments descendants Cossack, the impetus for the Ukrainian national revival to new international realities and ideological and political theory. The French Revolution called into life a new model of the nation (regardless of social class, all citizens of the state were considered representatives of a single nation), which became a model for other nations of Europe. Another strong stimulus Ukrainian movement was spreading Romanticism. Romantics glorified people and its song culture and traditions as an expression of a kind of national spirit.</p>
<p>Concept Romantics influenced the collection of ethnographic material. In 1819 in St. Petersburg was published the first collection of Ukrainian historical thoughts that gathered M.Tsertelyev. In 1827 came the publication of Ukrainian songs, prepared by Michael Maksimovic. This collection influenced the work of Shevchenko, Gogol, Pushkin and others.</p>
<p>The influence of romanticism was particularly noticeable in Slobozhanschyna. In Kharkiv University, which opened in 1805, in the 1820-1830's literary circle in force, which played a significant role in the development of modern Ukrainian literature. Soul of the circle was a philologist Sreznevsky. In 1831 he published "Ukrainian Almanac" - a collection of folk songs and original poetry poets Kharkov, and in 1833-1838 gg. - Six issues of "Zaporizhia starina." Sreznevsky become agents of Slavic unity.</p>
<p>Romantic trend in Ukrainian literature until the 30-40-ies of the XIX century. coexisted with classicism. This is seen in the work of Kotlyarevskyi. The poem "Aeneid" (1798) is a model of classical literature and play "Nedorosl" - Romanticism.</p>
<p>Along with active attempts ethnographers and writers expand intellectual horizons Ukrainian world appear first professional historical works - "History of Malaya Russia" (1822), Bantysh Dmitry Kamensky, "History Malorossyy" Nikolai Markevich.</p>
<p>Historical and folklore studies gave answers to questions about the historical roots and cultural difference of the Ukrainian nation. Although the literary and scientific movement had organized form, collection of cultural heritage has created a favorable environment for the formation of the modern Ukrainian consciousness.</p>
<p>5. Cyril and Methodius - the first political organization. Shevchenko</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Europe sprang the idea of ​​the French Revolution, social and national liberation, there was politicization of the national liberation struggle of the Slavic peoples in the Russian Empire, brutal autocratic regime of Nicholas I pursued all manifestations of liberalism and free thinking.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, in the early 1846 in Kiev was established real illegal Ukrainian political organization - Cyril and Methodius (Brotherhood), named after the famous Slavic educators Cyril and Methodius. Among the founders were teachers from Poltava Belozersky Vasil, Clerk's Office Southwestern Krai Nicholas Gulak and professor of the Kiev University Notes on Nicholas. Active participation in the activities of the company were Taras Shevchenko, Panteleimon Kulish et al.</p>
<p>The Association proclaimed the struggle against feudalism and the national liberation of the Ukrainian people. Members of the Ukrainian state saw in a federal union of independent Slavic countries, each of which would constitute a state or rozmezhovuvalasya least a few states. Kyiv was to become the central city of the federal union in which every four years was going to be the highest joint advisory and regulatory body - the cathedral (or Diet). To protect the Federation from external enemies supposed to have a small regular army, and each state, moreover, would have and their forces. The idea of ​​Slavic peoples liberation from the foreign yoke and their union was supposed to spread mainly literary and educational activities. They sought to rebuild society on Christian principles.</p>
<p>The program of the Company was described in historical and journalistic work, "Genesis of the Ukrainian people" or "Act of God". It sets out the provisions of 109 religious, educational, historical and journalistic nature. In most cases, the content relates to the events of world and national history. The work describes the liberation struggle of the Ukrainian Cossacks and development despotic autocracy in Russia, the French Revolution and Decembrists deed of partition of Poland neighboring empires. Cyril and Methodians were convinced that the Ukrainian people had a historical mission to be the initiator of the struggle for national and social liberation of the Slavic peoples. In addition to programs developed Statutes organization. It more specific idea of ​​the equality of nations, states and citizens of the future of the Republican Slavic federation, setting out the statutory rights and duties of Cyril and Methodius.</p>
<p>His practice Cyril and Methodians focused on the research and education field. "Brothers" to collect funds for the publication of popular books, were the projects implementation in Ukraine network of primary schools, concluded textbooks.</p>
<p>Cyril and Methodius lasted just over a year. In the spring of 1847 royal authorities arrested 12 permanent members of the Society and sent to St. Petersburg. All participants Cyril and Methodius was sent to various places of empire. Shevchenko was punished most severe for arrest manuscript found its antytsarskyh and anti-serfdom works. He was exiled for 10 years as a private soldier in the then sparsely populated steppes of Orenburg strict ban king of anything to write and draw.</p>
<p>The value of Cyril and Methodius Brotherhood is that it was the first attempt to access the Ukrainian intelligentsia political struggle; Brotherhood for the first time developed a broad political agenda of the national liberation movement, which became a model for his successors.</p>
<p>Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861) played a crucial role in the Ukrainian national liberation movement. Born in the family of a serf, he thanks to his talent and destiny will able to get, to get a good education. His achievements as an artist were considerable. But even more was his poetic talent. His collection of poems "Kobzar" which was published in 1840, was one of the foundations of ideas and Ukrainian Ukrainian movement.</p>
<p>The "poet" reaches far beyond literature. Shevchenko's speech was not just playing national language; he did it on the basis of three Ukrainian dialects (south-east, north and north-west), the elements of the Church Slavonic language and the linguistic material of early Ukrainian literature. The result was distinguished by simplicity and naturalness of sound that verbally genius poet. Shevchenko has laid a foundation of modern Ukrainian literature and, in a broad sense - and the Ukrainian national revival.</p>
<p>Even more important was the political aspect of his work. Poem "The Dream", "Caucasus", "And the dead and the living ..." and "Will" awakened national feeling and gave vision of Ukraine as an independent state. It is like no other before him, accused the Russian emperors in the enslavement of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Another great merit Shevchenko was that in his work he combined two by then separated jets Cossack traditions - prostolyudnyy and petty. His hatred of social injustice and vbolivannya for the freedom and dignity of the common man derived from his peasant origins. But his intellectual achievements he owed influences Ukrainian nobility. Shevchenko could read all strata of society, finding in his poetry reflected his interests. Shevchenko's call for national and social liberation became the ideological foundation of modern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Shevchenko's work is a watershed in the development of Ukrainian idea. It laid the foundation for the transformation of the ethnic community in a politically conscious nation. All later Ukrainian national movement in varying degrees, was removed from his poetry. And his martyr's personal fortune has become a source for its creation of a strong national myth that has inspired the next generation of Ukrainian leaders.</p>
<p>6. The rise of the national liberation struggle in Galicia in 20-30 years. XIX centuries. "N trinity"</p>
<p>Western areas (Galicia, Bukovina, Transcarpathia) at the end of the eighteenth century. were under the Austrian Empire. Their inclusion in the empire coincided with the reform efforts of the emperors of Maria Theresa and Joseph II. The reforms led to the awakening of national life in Western. Specificity of national revival in the region was that the main carriers Ukrainian national idea was the clergy.</p>
<p>National revival swept the first Transcarpathia through the activities of adherents of the late XVIII - early XIX centuries. appeared galaxy of eminent personalities. Thus, the first rector of the Petrograd University Press Baludyanskyy was Michael, director John Eagle Nijinsky school, was active in a scientific field Hutsa Yuri Venelin. In Lviv University professors Michael Schavnytskyy John Zemanchyk Peter Lodi.</p>
<p>The most prominent adherents was the first historian Transcarpathia Ioanykiy Bazylovych. He continued his work Michael Luchkay.</p>
<p>Through the activities of Bishop Andrew Bachinsky (1772-1809), founder of the Mukachevo eparchy, and M. Luchkaya managed to preserve and revive the national identity of the population Ukrainian Transcarpathia.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the nineteenth century. process of national revival swept and Galicia. In 1816 on the initiative of the priest I.Mohylnytskoho in Przemysl in Galicia there was the first cultural and educational organization - "Society priests", around which hurtuvalosya public-spirited Greek Catholic clergy. Society became an active defender of the rights of Ukrainian language Ukrainianization champion of education. Members of the emperor vigorously promoted the adoption of a decision in 1818 on admission to primary school Ukrainian language. From the pen of the participants came first Ukrainian grammar - I.Mohylnytskoho, Y.Lozynskoho, Y.Levytskoho.</p>
<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century. center of the national movement in Galicia was the Lions. Here in the early 30s there was a semi-legal democratic and educational and literary groups "n trinity" (founders - M. Shashkevych, I.Vahylevych and Y.Holovatskyi), which intervened on behalf of the Ukrainian language (the term "n" to mean Galician Ukrainian ).</p>
<p>The feature of the emergence and activities of socio-cultural association "Ruska trinity" is that it, as a distinctive bright representative of the cultural stage of the Ukrainian national movement, at the same time preserves some features of folklore and ethnographic stage and made the first attempts to break into the political stage.</p>
<p>Being heavily influenced by the Poles, the works of historians (D.Bantysh-Kamensky), ethnographers (M.Maksymovych) and writers (Kotlyarevskyi) in Dnieper Ukraine, members of the "Russian troika" saw their main task in raising the status and prestige of the Ukrainian language expansion of its use and influence, the desire to "raise people's spirit, to educate people," his best contribute to the awakening of national consciousness.</p>
<p>The activity of members of the group began to study the life, traditions and history of their own people. With notebooks in hand Y.Holovatskyi I.Vahylevych and visited many towns and villages in Galicia, Bukovina and Transcarpathia. The result of this kind of "going to the people" were not only numerous collections of materials from ethnology, folklore, history and linguistics, but also knowledge of the real situation of the modern Ukrainian nation under foreign oppression. During his ethnographic journeys they had contact with the Polish underground to train anti-government protests, but "n trinity" is not followed by revolutionary conspirators, stressing the cultural-educational activities.</p>
<p>The first manuscript collections of poetry and translations, called "Son of Russia" (1833), they called for national unity and national awakening. The next step "Ruthenian Triad" was prepared for publication a collection of "Dawn" (1834), which included folk songs and original compositions hurtkivtsiv, historical and journalistic materials. The tenor of the manuscript was the condemnation of foreign domination, the struggle of the people of praise, glorification Cossack leaders - B.Khmelnytskyi and S. Nalyvaiko. Sounded in the assembly and call for unity Ukrainian Galicia and Dnieper. The publication of this book was banned Vienna and Lviv censorship. First tried to suppress the expression of the Ukrainian movement in Galicia, for fear that he could become pro. Second, reflecting the interests of the conservative leaders of the Greek Catholic Church, were not so much against the content as against forms: the emergence of books in Ukrainian posyahala monopoly and authority of the Church Slavonic language. For young authors banned "Dawn" began a period of harassment, searches, denunciations, accusations of unreliability. The principal accusation was formulated by the Director of the Lviv police: "These fools want to resurrect the dead ... Rusyn nationality."</p>
<p>However, even in these adverse conditions, members of the "Ruthenian Triad" did not stop the activity. They are breaking the conservative tradition that included the official speeches pronouncing Latin, Polish or German, while in the three churches of the city read religious and moral preaching Ukrainian. "Triychany" vigorously opposed the romanization literature, strongly supported the return of the native language in the life of national intelligence. In 1836 M. Shashkevych prepared a textbook for primary school children - "reader" written by live Ukrainian.</p>
<p>At the end of 1836 (in the book mentioned in 1837) in Budapest was released anthology "Mermaid Dnistrovaya." Although the idea of ​​liberation heard it with much less force than the "Dawn", only 200 copies of this collection fall into the hands of readers, the rest was confiscated. What frightened the authorities this time? It was a pioneering work in both form and content. It is written in lively vernacular, phonetic spelling, "hrazhdanskym" type. This collection of allocated contemporary literary stream, made her close and understandable to the masses. Three ideas permeate the content of "Mermaid Dniester": the recognition of the unity of the Ukrainian people, separated by boundaries of different states, and call for its renewal; positive attitude to social movements and people's praise leaders - fighters for social and national liberation; promotion of ideas of their own state and political independence. Clearly, the authors build a certain extent moved beyond cultural-with the educational activities and intruded into the political sphere.</p>
<p>Analyzing the reasons for the prohibition of work "Ruthenian Triad" Franko said: "Mermaid Dnistrovaya" although that little content that vague thought it vyskazani - was at one time through a revolutionary phenomenon. "It was a strong statement against the traditional political and social authority .</p>
<p>Soon the association dissolved. Pursued by secular and ecclesiastical authority, 32 th year, died M.Shashkevych. In 1848 moved to the position of pro-Polish I.Vahylevych, who began to preach the idea of ​​Polish-Ukrainian Union under the auspices of Poland. Longer advocated the idea of ​​"Russian troika" Y.Holovatskyi. But he influenced M.Pohodina joined Muscophiles in 1867 emigrated to Russia.</p>
<p>7. The events of the revolution of 1848-1849. At Western. Chief Rus Council</p>
<p>In 1848-1849. Europe was hit by a pan-democratic revolution. It was directed against the regime of reaction, which established after the defeat of Napoleon's empire and against the remnants of feudalism. As a result of the revolution for the first time in the history of the political life of Europe to participate masses. In European countries began the establishment of democratic institutions and civil society. Democratization of life, the rise of social movements, gave impetus to the deployment of the national liberation struggle of oppressed peoples of Eastern and Central Europe.</p>
<p>During the revolution, the center of the Ukrainian national movement was Eastern Galicia. He launched a group of representatives of the Greek Catholic clergy, which appealed to the Emperor of Austria April 19, 1848 with a petition. It expressed the wish: implementation in schools and public institutions in Eastern Galicia the Ukrainian language, Ukrainian providing access to all jobs and equal rights of the clergy of all denominations.</p>
<p>May 2, 1848 in Lviv was founded by first Ukrainian political organization - Home Ruthenian (Ukrainian) council, which took over the role of representative of the Ukrainian population of Galicia to the central government and performed it for the 1848-1851 biennium. Council, which consisted of 30 permanent members - representatives of secular intellectuals, higher and lower clergy, led by Bishop Gregory Yakhimovich.</p>
<p>Printed organ of the Supreme Ruthenian Council was "Galician Dawn" - the first in Ukraine Ukrainian language newspaper that began publication on May 15, 1848</p>
<p>On the initiative of exploration for Galician Ukrainian national symbols were adopted blue and yellow flag and coat of arms depicting a golden lion on a blue background. PGR, advocating democratic reform, sought to provide free national development of the Ukrainian population of Eastern Galicia. Its program are associated with devotion Austrian constitutional monarchy. In cities, towns and villages of eastern Galicia orhanizuvalosya about 50 local councils of n, composed of elected representatives from various sectors, mainly farmers, tradesmen, secular intellectuals (teachers), representatives of the lower clergy, who launched an active socio-political, cultural and educational activities . Groups began forming self-defense - the National Guard.</p>
<p>Ruthenian Council was organized struggle of the Ukrainian population by separating East from West Galicia (Poland) and turning it into a separate province, ie its national and territorial autonomy, the introduction of instruction in all schools in their mother tongue.</p>
<p>The ruling circles of Austria, ignoring the demands of Ukrainian, yet agreed to the introduction of the 1848 study Ukrainian language in public schools and the teaching of the language as a compulsory subject in schools. In early 1849 the department opened Ukrainian in Lviv University. It was the first Professor J. Holovatsky.</p>
<p>Part of the struggle for democratic reforms was the revival of cultural and educational movement in the province. In October 1848 Lviv hosted the first congress of leaders of Ukrainian culture and science. According to the decision of the Congress was founded in Lviv "Galician-Ruthenian like a vagina" - cultural and educational organization, which had the task of publishing popular books for the people.</p>
<p>The national movement in Western Ukraine 1848-1849. Has developed an extensive program of national political and spiritual affirmation Ukrainians within the Austrian constitutional monarchy. In the summer of 1849 after the defeat of the combined forces of Austria and the Hungarian Revolution in the Habsburg Empire was restored absolutist regime with its centralist-bureaucratic system. Austrian constitution canceled. In the summer of 1851 dissolved the Supreme Ruthenian Council. Important were the social consequences of the revolution of 1848-1849. Thus, serfdom was abolished, farmers received complete personal freedom. The land, which peasants used, passed on their property. However, the best lands, communal lands (forests, pastures) remained in the hands of landlords.</p>
