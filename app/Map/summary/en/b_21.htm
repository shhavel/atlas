<p>Agro-climatic resources - is the ratio of heat, moisture, light needed for growing crops. They are defined by geographic location within the territory of climatic zones and natural areas. Characterize the three agro-climatic resources indicators.</p>
<p>The amount of active air temperatures (sum of daily average temperature above 10 Â° C), in which the fastest growing plants.</p>
<p>The duration of active temperatures (vegetation period) during which temperatures are favorable for plant growth. There are short and long periods serednotryvalyy vegetation;</p>
<p>Availability of plant moisture (determined by the coefficient of moisture).</p>
<p>Moisturizing factor - determined by the ratio of heat and moisture in a particular area and is calculated as the ratio of precipitation to evaporation during the year. The higher the temperature, the higher the volatility and hence, lower coefficient of moisture. The smaller the coefficient of moisture, the drier climate.</p>
<p>Heat and rain on the earth divided according to the latitudinal zonation and altitudinal zonation. Therefore, the supply of agro-climatic resources on Earth isolated agro-climatic zones, and pidpoyasy zonyzvolozhennya who have latitudinal distribution on the flat area, and in the mountains change with height. For each agro-climatic zone and pidpoyasu are examples of typical crops clarifying the length of the growing season. Supplement to the map is a map of Agro-climatic Resources Types of winter, which will help in characterizing the preconditions for the development and specialization of agriculture around the world.</p>
<p>Depending on the geographical location of the country with a variety of agro-climatic resources. These resources are inexhaustible, but their quality may vary with climate change and under the influence of human activities.</p>
