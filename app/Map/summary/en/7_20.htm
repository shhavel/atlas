<p><b>Main presentation</b></p>
<p><b>1. Development of the Ukrainian language</b></p>
<p>Ukrainian origins date back to ancient Slavic people, still peredderzhavnyy times.</p>
<p>Then, according to scientists, began to form the Ukrainian language, because the formation of a separate nation and its language development occurs simultaneously.</p>
<p>In the 9-13 centuries. in our language already had most of the features that distinguish it from other Slavic languages.</p>
<p>It also differed from the modern. That is why the time history of language researchers use the term pre-Ukrainian.</p>
<p><b>Writing</b></p>
<p>Language researchers say that in the second half of the 9th - early 10th century. our ancestors there was writing.</p>
<p>That ancient alphabet was created from the Greek - and this is not surprising given the long association of the Eastern Slavs with the Greeks; Byzantium with which the young Russian state had the closest relationship, the official language was also Greek.</p>
<p>Evidence of their own original alphabet in old Ukrainian is finding inscriptions on the walls of St. Sophia Cathedral.</p>
<p>Kyiv scribe in the 11th century. carefully wrote on the walls just built the temple of the alphabet that differs from prevailing at the time the Cyrillic created for the transfer in writing in one of the South Slavic languages ​​using Greek letters brothers Cyril and Methodius and transferred to our territories with the adoption of Christianity.</p>
<p>From the adoption of Christianity in our land spread Old Church Slavonic or starobolharska literary language - the language of the Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>Significantly different from narodnorozmovnoyi language, she still had it in common, as based on close, too Slavic language, and so was understandable, especially educated people - clergy, princes and boyars.</p>
<p>Scientists say that your Kyiv Rus existed two options written language, Church Slavonic, which were written the most important liturgical books, and Church Slavonic with large patches of live speech (for a later time it is called Old Ukrainian portrait) - her writing various documents and literary works secular trend.</p>
<p>However, both written language significantly different from living contemporary Ukrainian language, which is used in speech.</p>
<p>And it was not only in the Ruthenian lands, but also elsewhere in Europe, where the literary (portrait) language for many people was Latin.</p>
<p><b>2. Distribution of Literature</b></p>
<p><b>Book of Interest</b></p>
<p>In our time of Kievan Rus' and Galicia-Volyn state have very few books.</p>
<p>Oldest among them is</p>
<p>Reims Gospel, Gospel Ostrom, "Miscellany Svyatoslav" in 1073 and "Miscellany" in 1076, and Mstislav Gospel.</p>
<p>This list is headed by a glorious Reims Gospel, which was brought to France the daughter of Yaroslav the Wise, Anna.</p>
<p>Scholars date its 40-mi's. 11th century.</p>
<p>His name Reims Gospel owes the city of Reims in France, where it remains today, although Kiev scribes created it - especially for the princely family.</p>
<p>The oldest dated monument portrait of Russia is Ostrom Gospel.</p>
<p>We created this book in Kiev in 1056-1057 gg., As evidenced by the special account.</p>
<p>Ostrom Gospel - a monument of extraordinary artistic value.</p>
<p>Among the oldest books that have survived to this day, there are those that are intended for secular reading. This is a "Izborniks" - collection of various works of Greek authors of theological and instructive content, most of which explains the complex areas where the Bible is, as it were, a kind of encyclopedic.</p>
<p>They survived two - 1073 and 1076 The first name in the title keeps Kievan prince Svyatoslav Yaroslav, though, as noted by the researchers, this book ordered his brother - Prince Iziaslav.</p>
<p>"Miscellany Svyatoslav" richly ornamented with miniatures, miniatures, and numerous initials.</p>
<p>"Miscellany" 1076 decorated with much more modest, though not inferior to the first scribe carefully.</p>
<p>From the book monuments of the 12th century. The most famous Mstislav Gospel rewritten about 1115</p>
<p>Mstislav Gospel was written in Kyiv on request Mstislav Vladimirovich, son of Grand Prince of Kiev, Vladimir Monomakh.</p>
<p>A few books monuments preserved from the times of Kievan Rus' and Galicia-Volyn state are rare pearls from the vast wealth of the book that it was our land.</p>
<p>According to scientists in the 13th century. on the territory of Russia was to be 130 - 140 thousand. Books hundreds of items, because such a number of churches and monasteries needed - the main centers of literacy.</p>
<p>According to researchers, only in Sofia stacks were up to 950 volumes of manuscript books.</p>
<p>Many books were created i copied Galicia-Volynskiy State. Great knyhopysna workshop existed, particularly in the yard of Prince Vladimir Vasylkovych</p>
<p><b>3. Education</b></p>
<p>Literate by the princely times were not only officials and people from the environment of the clergy, but also artisans and ordinary warriors.</p>
<p>Concern about education from the time of the introduction of Christianity took over the state and the church.</p>
<p>Under the reign of Vladimir in Kiev Svyatoslav already existed a school for children with learning entourage of the prince.</p>
<p>Year 1086 the grandson of Yaroslav the Wise Janka Vsevolodovna founded in Kiev St. Andrew Monastery school for women.</p>
<p>Finds of birch-bark letters, bronze and bone wrote argue that literary science developed not only in the capital city, but also in various parts of Russia.</p>
<p>For example, birch bark found in Zvenyhorodi and Brest, bronze writing for writing on wax tablets - in Zvenyhorodi, Peremyshli, Halychi, jail.</p>
<p><b>4. The development of literature</b></p>
<p><b>Folklore</b></p>
<p>Even before the advent of writing among the Eastern Slavs were many folklore, folk songs, legends, riddles, stories, spells, epic and lyric songs.</p>
<p>From Kievan Rus' and Galicia-Volyn principality Us've got legends and tales, druzhynni, Festive, wedding songs, stories, carols, prysliv'ya, prypovidky, mahichni spells and charms.</p>
<p>A monument of Old Russian creativity were epic.</p>

<p>In the 13-14 centuries. epics are filled with new stories related to the particular realities of Galicia-Volyn state: Prince of Romance, Michael Kozaryna and others.</p>
<p><b>Translated literary monuments</b></p>
<p>The beginnings of literary life in our area, except usnopoetychnoyi work, had another source - the literary works of other people who, because Church Slavonic translations came after the introduction of Christianity.</p>
<p>With assimilation of Russian lands to the Christian world our ancestors opened the richest treasury of human experience and wisdom - the Bible.</p>
<p>In passing, we note that the translation of the Holy Scriptures not only had an invaluable impact on the people of that period, but also triggered the verbal creativity, as the Bible - an inexhaustible source of eternal themes, ideas and images.</p>
<p>In addition to the Bible and the Apocrypha were translated - works on biblical themes, which for various reasons were not recognized by the church.</p>
