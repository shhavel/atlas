<p>Ukrainian lands in the late eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of the Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774 gg.) When no longer need to Host, Catherine II decides to eliminate the last bastion of Ukrainian liberty and defender of human rights and freedoms in Ukraine. With the elimination of Zaporozhye 1775 the tsarist government reorganized the administrative structure Ukraine. In 1782 it was abolished regimental-centesimal Left-bank Ukraine and created Little Russian Governor-General, which consisted of three province - Kiev, Chernigov and Novgorod-Seversky. Local government also reorganized to general pattern in the provincial cities created namisnytski government, chambers of criminal and civil cases, the provincial council and others. In each of the counties, which divided the province, acted the same control system. All newly created local governments have acted on the basis of General legislation.</p>
<p>In 1783 left-bank was liquidated Cossack regiments and created 10 regular cavalry regiments (from 1784 renamed karabinerski). Cossack officers received the orders of the Russian army. Cossacks who did not go to the carabinieri, were transformed into state-owned, and farmers had to provide recruits to karabinerskyh regiments. As a result, Ukrainian Cossacks were liquidated as a class.</p>
<p>Other legal status of Ukrainian society was brought into compliance with the General rules. In 1783 Catherine II issued a decree on the introduction of serfdom in Ukraine, and in 1785 - "charter of rights, freedoms and benefits of a noble Russian nobility," which urivnyuvala Ukrainian officers in the rights of the Russian nobility.</p>
<p>Due to the elimination of the Zaporozhian Sich and the Russo-Turkish war of 1768-1774. And 1788-1791 years. Russia became the owner of vast areas of the South. The extraordinary fertility of the Black Sea steppes promised big profits in the future and made the South the most attractive for the development of all regions that became part of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich ordinary Cossacks, who lived in the old Cossack villages have turned to military settlers. The Russian government encouraged everyone to migrate to the land. Aliens receive financial aid. By 1784 the new lands were distributed 4,470,302 acres of land mainly Germans and Bulgarians, Romanians, Hungarians, Serbs, Greeks and Russians.</p>
<p>After the liquidation of New Host its lands were incorporated into the Azov Novorossiysk province. Governor General of both provinces in 1776 was appointed Prince Grigory Potemkin (1739-1791). In 1783 the two provinces created Ekaterinoslavskoe Viceroyalty, which included also the Crimea (Tauris region). Potemkin did a lot for the development and regulation of these areas. Was conducted census, done detailed maps, lists of land owners. To speed up the settlement, Potemkin introduced order in which the landlord had to provide for 10 years here resettlement of villagers in the ratio of 60 acres each farm. The maximum allotment for landowners was determined in 12 thousand acres. Also banned Potemkin return of these lands peasant refugees.</p>
<p>At the same time began development of mineral resources in the region - ore and coal drunk.</p>
<p>Along with the economic development of the land appeared many new cities. Cities such as Yelisavetgrad (Kirovograd), Novomyrhorod Novoarkhangelsk grown in place of forts laid down in those 40-50 years. In New Serbia. Alexandrovsk (Zaporozhye present) grew out of fortifications built in the 1770-1771's. For the Dnieper defense line. In place of the Cossack settlements Polovitsa in 1776 began construction Katerynoslav (Dnipropetrovsk). For the Greeks, whom the Russian government forced to resettle in Crimea, on the site of the village of Petrovsky in 1779 was founded Mariupol. In 1788 at the mouth of the river there was Inhul Nikolayev, where the creation of new marine shop. In 1795 on the site of the Turkish fortress Annie Danube (New Danube) in the area Hadzhibey began construction of Odessa.</p>
<p>1797, after a Ekaterinoslavskogo province, most of its territory became part of Novorossiysk province. For land edge stuck the name ship. Its population as of 1796 was 554 thousand. People.</p>
<p>In the South of Ukraine in the early development of new lands dominated sheep, and commodity grain production, which were exported. New ports were the main foreign trade in Russia. So on the steppe frontier south of Ukraine was to become the breadbasket of Europe and gate sales of the Russian Empire and later on the industrial base.</p>
<p>At the end of the eighteenth century. changes occurred on the Ukrainian lands were under the authority of the Commonwealth. In the second half of the XVIII century. Commonwealth experienced a decline: filvarkova system management and noble anarchy retarded economic development of the country, weakening it to external aggression. Weakening of Poland took advantage of neighboring countries - Russia, Prussia and Austria. They scared extending through Poland ideas of the Enlightenment and then the spirit of the French Revolution, so they planned to divide Poland and expand its territory at the expense of their possessions.</p>
<p>In 1772, the first partition of Poland, which resulted in almost the entire territory of Rus (without Chelm land), Belz, the western part of Volyn and Podolski provinces of Austria won. As a union of Ukrainian lands from southern Poland (Krakow, Sandomierz and Lublin) provinces were created so-called Kingdom of Galicia and Ladomeriyi. Prussia went to north-western part of Poland in Gdansk, the Russian - Belarusian lands east of Minsk and Vitebsk.</p>
<p>The reason for the second partition of Poland was that the four-year Sejm (1788-1792 gg.) Launched the country's major reforms, including adopted a constitution, which reflected the ideas of the French Revolution. Opponents of reform and constitution to limit the tyranny of the magnates and nobility, turned for help to neighbors. And they are not slow. To prevent the spread of revolutionary ideas and strengthen Poland, Russia and Prussia January 12, 1793 signed the Convention on the second partition of Poland. According to her Prussia western Polish lands from Poznan to Russia - the Right Bank Ukraine (Kiev region, Bratslavshchina, skirts) and the central part of Minsk in Belarus.</p>
<p>The second partition of Poland brought the country's rising national liberation movement. In March of 1794 broke out in Krakow Polish liberation uprising led by T. Kosciuszko. Right Bank Ukraine leaves and leaflets urging adherence to the uprising. However, a great popularity among the population they were not: the vast majority of Ukrainian peasants remained indifferent. Eventually the rebellion crushed the Russian army, led by Alexander Suvorov. Then, in 1795 was made the third partition of Poland, by which Russia received Volhynia, Western Belarus, Lithuania and Courland; Austria - Lublin and Krakow with surrounding areas; and Prussia - the rest of Polish lands Warsaw.</p>
<p>As a result of the Third Partition of Poland Polish people lost their statehood. Thus, 62% of the territory and 45% of the former Commonwealth Russia received 18% of the territory and 32% of the population - Austria, and, respectively, 20% and 23% went to Prussia. Such radical changes in the political map of Eastern Europe influenced the fate of Ukrainian. About 80% of Ukrainian population appeared in the Russian Empire.</p>
<p>Austria, taking advantage of the weakening of Turkey in the Russo-Turkish war, occupied in 1774 Bukovina. According to the Constantinople Protocol in 1775 is recognized by Austria. Now in the Austrian Habsburg monarchy were all western lands, Eastern Galicia, Transcarpathia and Northern Bukovina.</p>
<p>Right Bank Ukraine, after its annexation to Russia, introduced an administrative division: first, the province, and province. In 1797 was founded the Kiev (Kyiv center), Volyn (Novograd Volyn) and Podolsk (Kamenetz-Podolsk) province. However, in order not to aggravate relations with the local Polish nobility, the royal government granted her rights and privileges. She received the Russian nobility, retained ownership of estates and dependent peasants. Kept the old gentry legislation. However, senior positions in the administration of land occupied by representatives of the Russian administration. For the Ukrainian peasantry, who constituted the vast majority of Right Bank and most suffered from the tyranny of the Polish gentry, no change.</p>
