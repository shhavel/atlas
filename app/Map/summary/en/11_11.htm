<p>Ukraine in the years 1985 -1991. The struggle for independence</p>
<p>Chernobyl disaster, which occurred on the night of 25 to 26 April 1986 on the results of pollution has become a truly global scale disaster. Particularly tragic were the consequences for Europe. Around Chernobyl was established 30-kilometer evacuation zone population. In Ukraine, according to official figures, according to 16 areas contaminated areas, and in fact - all regions of the republic, including the Kyiv more or less subjected to the harmful effects of radiation. In disaster relief only in 1988 - 1990 рр. Spent in the prevailing prices of more than 20 billion rubles. In general, the needs of the aftermath spent annually to 7% of the State Budget of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Radioactive contamination caused by the disaster, is the causative agent of cancer in the population, especially children of preschool and school age; it adversely affects the overall health status of the population.</p>
<p>Restructuring and Ukraine</p>
<p>After the death of Chernenko in March 1985 as General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev was elected. It was on his initiative in April 1985 launched perestroika in the USSR. The restructuring was to cover five major areas of society: economy (transition from extensive to intensive methods of management), internal politics (democratization of public life and democracy), foreign policy (stop "cold war" and building a common European home); social services (improvement of material and cultural well-being of the population); ideology (the elimination of censorship, openness, free expression of public opinion). In theory, the idea of ​​perestroika had a chance to implement, but, as events showed, in addition to general declarations, Gorbachev could not for a six-year period to propose any practical concept of reform Soviet society.</p>
<p>Restructuring quickly stalled, deepened the socio-political, economic and national crisis and ended with the collapse of the USSR. Party leadership Ukraine in words unequivocally supported the actions of the Kremlin leadership, in fact for some time blocked the restructuring process in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Perestroika had four stages. In March 1985 - January 1987 - the restructuring carried out under the motto "more socialism". In the period from 1987 to 1988 rr.- main motif - "more democracy", and 1989 - 1990 were characterized by differentiation and division in the camp leaders restructuring that resulted in the 1991 victory radical reformism and the collapse of the USSR.</p>
<p>Restructuring processes in Ukraine controlled range of managerial totalitarian state. During the 1985 - 1987's. In Ukraine there were no political parties in the form of NGOs and people's fronts, similar to those encountered in the Baltic States and Russia. The passivity of the masses is explained. Amid general, especially economic, collapse situation in Ukraine has remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>There was another important subjective factor. Publicity in the republics began with criticism of the first party leaders and party nomenklatura different rank. B. Shcherbytsky that seventeen years headed the Communist Party of Ukraine, remained orthodox Communist and become one of the opponents of Gorbachev. The press called Ukraine reserve stagnation.</p>
<p>The Chernobyl disaster (April 1986) contributed to the revitalization of social and political movement in the country. November 13, 1988 in Kiev for the first years of Soviet power the massive environmental rally (20 thousand. Participants). In addition to environmental issues, have been sharply criticized officials guilty of the Chernobyl disaster and its aftermath.</p>
<p>Ukraine in 1989, a wave of miner strikes that close to the economic demands placed badly and political issues - failure to trust nomenclature and bureaucrats-bureaucrats.</p>
<p>In a sharp worsening socio-economic crisis, rising prices and the relentless deterioration of living standards in the spring of 1990 held the first democratic parliamentary elections that increased separation of forces.</p>
<p>In September 1989 there was a mass political organization - Movement (People's Movement of Ukraine for Perestroika). One by one, created by the political parties of Ukraine (Ukrainian Republican Party, Democratic Party of Ukraine, "Green Party", Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, etc.). July 16, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, which was the harbinger of independence.</p>
<p>"Transparency". Back in the late 1980s - early 1990s. The people the truth about the past of Ukraine</p>
<p>In the mid-1880s. In the USSR began "restructuring." Restructuring initiative belonged to a small group of leaders of the Communist Party, united around a new General Secretary Gorbachev. Today, when Gorbachev's political career is over, we can conclude that the reformers from the very beginning is not our task to destroy the totalitarian system. Conceived reforms have not been clearly defined. It was the "acceleration", "renewal", a return to the "Leninist principles," "the new face of socialism" and so on. P.</p>
<p>Rebuilding begins with information. Arose purely Soviet term "transparency", which entered the foreign language without translation. In the transition from totalitarianism to democracy, transparency means a kind of transitional stage between long-term period of silent odnodumstva to freedom of speech. Transparency - the right to know what is happening in the country and the world.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 1980's - early 1990's. In a state where all the information structure was under strict control, as an intermediate step towards freedom of speech, as publicity was particularly necessary. Thanks to the publicity people overcome stereotypes and dogmas of the old thinking, got an opportunity to really assess the situation, using objective information to make their own conclusions. Society is rapidly polityzuvalosya.</p>
<p>Pioneering role in the protection of Ukrainian culture, the environment, "blank spots" of history played Writers' Union of Ukraine and its central body - the newspaper "Literary Ukraine". Wide publicity had performances Gonchar, R. Bratunya, I. Dziuba, J. Drach, V. Drozd and many others. In Ukraine, began to return the works of Vynnychenka Petliura, representatives of "Executed Renaissance", including Wave M., M. Kulish, M. Zerov, historical works Hrushevskoho Kostomarov prohibited works of I. Dziuba "Internationalism or Russification? "Braychevsky M." Annexation or reunion? ", repressed during the" stagnation "Vasyl Stus, E. Sverstyuk, I. and I. Kalynets. In Ukraine, returned from exile writer and co-founder of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group (UHG) M. Rudenko.</p>
<p>The country began to spread "samvydavski" newspapers and magazines. Some of them are prepared outside Ukraine reflects the union problems, others were prepared in the country. In 1987 W. CHORNOVIL resumed publication "Ukrainian Herald".</p>
<p>Gradually became revealed the truth about these pages Ukrainian history of the twentieth century. As the Central Council, hunger 1921 - 1922 gg. Famine of 1932 - 1933., Forced collectivization, Stalin's repressions, OUN - UPA other tragic history of the Ukrainian people; a discussion about national symbols.</p>
<p>Increased interest in the historical past of the Ukrainian people was manifested in the active participation of the masses in celebrating the anniversary of the events before the official historiography writing avoiding or covering biased. Most Reviewed politics gained publicity in. In June and July 1988 there have been several unauthorized and unprecedented in scale rallies, who led the former dissident Vladimir CHORNOVIL, Horyn brothers, Igor and Irina Kalynets. At these meetings publicly stated on numerous oppressions experienced by Ukrainian.</p>
<p>In June 1986 Ukrainian writers, among them A. Potter, D.Pavlychko, Ivan Drach, opposed the exclusion of items in the schools of the republic of the Ukrainian language. According to Education Minister V. Fomenko, Ukraine in 1987 in Russian-language schools enrolled more than half of all students, and in Kiev from 300 thousand. Students studying in Ukrainian only 70 thousand. However, these statistics are not worried about the current party functionaries. The party apparatus Ukraine was in no hurry to change national policy.</p>
<p>In February 1989 the Society was based Ukrainian language to them. Shevchenko, who acted outside party control, "Lion Society," "Green Light".</p>
<p>Quick politicization of society manifested in rallies and demonstrations, the most popular among them was the human chain January 21, 1990 to celebrate the anniversary of the Act of Unification of the UPR and ZUNR.</p>
<p>Under pressure from the Democratic Forces Supreme Council of the USSR in 1989 adopted the Law on the language by which it acquired the status of Ukrainian state. Citizens of Ukraine provided legal guarantees for the free use of the Russian language and the languages ​​of other nationalities living in the republic.</p>
<p>In early August 1990 in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhia oblasts as a nationwide celebration of Cossack glory days were devoted to the 500th anniversary of Ukrainian Cossacks.</p>
<p>Transparency, liberalization, return to the people the truth about his past undermined the Soviet ideological stamps, accelerated the process of achieving genuine sovereignty of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The growth of political activism Ukrainian society in the second half of the 1980s. The new public associations
<p>In the early 1980's. Vtyahuvalos society deeper in the total socio-economic, political and ideological crisis, and the "grass roots" growing dissatisfaction, frustration and indifference. The "top" formed reformist forces grouped around the new General Secretary Gorbachev C CRC elected to this position in March 1985</p>
<p>In 1986. XXVII Congress of the CPSU defined the policy of "acceleration" - catching the USSR from advanced countries. At the January Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee in 1987, Gorbachev declared a policy of restructuring, ie, improving, updating the Soviet system, and transparency. Ukraine was among the latter, who was involved in these processes.</p>
<p>Since economic reform was met with resistance inside of the CPSU, Gorbachev adopted a policy of liberalization. He sought the help of "transparency," "socialist pluralism" under the slogan of "perestroika" Stalinist model of socialism and a return to "Leninist principles" to activate the masses and controlling this activity again, loosen the reactionaries.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the political situation was changing very slowly as the leaders of the republic took a conservative stance. In the first years of perestroika, glasnost proclaimed in Moscow had changed the face of the Republican press.</p>
<p>In terms of liberalization in Ukraine there are groups of "green" political clubs, educational organizations ukrainovedcheskie ("Lion Society" 1987 club "Heritage" in 1988 and the student association "Community"). Their work immediately beyond the purely educational and becomes politicized. In the autumn of 1987 in Kiev appeared Ukrainian Cultural Club (UKK). In an attempt to hold in 1988 a demonstration before the second anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe UKK several leaders were arrested. At the end of 1987 out of detention and returned to the Ukraine-known human rights activists, including CHORNOVIL B. and M. Gorin, in January 1989 she L. Lukyanenko. In 1988 the official celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the introduction of Christianity in Russia was used dissidents in Ukraine to draw attention to the fate of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the UCC.</p>
<p>Great influence on the situation in Ukraine was the emergence of popular movements in the Soviet Union, especially in the Baltic republics. July 7, 1988 Ukrainian Helsinki Union, based on the restored UGG, published the Declaration of Principles for a number of provisions of the program was close to the principle of popular movements in the Baltic republics: the transformation of the USSR into a confederation of independent states; The Ukrainian language; the release of all political prisoners and others.</p>
<p>In September 1989 at the initiative of the Union of Writers of Ukraine, supported by historical and educational society "Memorial" (inaugural conference - May 1989) and the Society of Ukrainian language to them. Shevchenko (inaugural conference - February 1989), there was a mass political organization - Movement (People's Movement of Ukraine for Perestroika).</p>
<p>Baptism of fire for new activists, NGOs became Elections of People's Deputies of the USSR in the spring of 1989, when for decades in the Soviet electoral system in one place claimed several candidates, but also put forward a "bottom." Despite antydemokratyzm Election Law, managed to hold a number of MPs from the opposition. In Lviv, waving yellow and blue flags, there were calls for a strike.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1989 miners' strike has captured the most important coal mining areas of the USSR, including the Donbass (strike 250 thousand. People) and Lviv-Volyn basin. Although they are then put forward primarily economic demands, but the Communist Party could not have put himself defender of the interests of the working class.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1989 failed to make substantial amendments to the Law on Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in particular, was filmed representation of NGOs. Then Parliament passed the law on languages, according to which it proclaimed Ukrainian state.</p>
<p>In 1989 - 1990 рр. Multiparty shoots appear. Activation of politics led to the rapid growth of national consciousness. Since 1990 began a movement for secession from the USSR. July 16, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, which proclaimed the supremacy, independence, fullness and indivisibility of the republic authorities within its territory, independence and equality in external relations.</p>
<p>Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine and its historical significance</p>
<p>As part of the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR XII convocation (1990 - 1994 gg.) An absolute majority of members (239 people) were members of the Communist Party. But the idea of ​​national revival independence manifested itself increasingly insistent mouth and minority - of the national-democratic deputies. The party and state leadership of the republic could not resist these sentiments and took a step that is contrary to the policy center.</p>
<p>Adopted July 16, 1990 Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine Ukraine declared will of the people to decide their own fate.</p>
<p>Ukraine's independence</p>
<p>In 1989-1990. In the USSR, along with social and economic problems sharply raised the issue of changing the country's political system. March 17, 1991 hosted the All-Union referendum on preserving the Soviet Union. In Ukraine during this referendum, Parliament invited the residents of the republic additional question: "Do you agree that Ukraine should be part of the Soviet Union of sovereign states on the basis of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine?"</p>
<p>The people of Ukraine responded positively as the primary (70.2% of those who took part in the vote), and the additional question (80.2%). Despite the contradictory results of the referendum and polls, it is clear that public opinion in Ukraine leans towards independence.</p>
<p>After the referendum began the so-called "Novooharovskyy process" -, heads of the nine republics, including Ukraine with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on a new union contract. Having signed the contract planned for August 20, 1991 This was the last attempt to save Gorbachev Soviet state integrity compromise between the republics and the center. In this process interfered with the conservative forces that sought to not only save a single union state, but also to prevent its renewal in any form.</p>
<p>August 19, 1991 reactionaries attempted coup. Blocking Gorbachev at his dacha in Foros, closest co-Soviet President announced the creation of State Committee on the State of Emergency (DKNS, ros.- Emergency Committee), which included eight people. Among them, the vice-president of the USSR G. Yanayev, Prime Minister Pavlov, head of the KGB Vladimir Kryuchkov, Defense Minister D. Yazov, Interior Minister Boris Pugo.</p>
<p>They declared their intention to restore order in the country and prevent the collapse of the USSR. Pryzupynyalasya political parties, public organizations and mass movements. Forbidden rallies, demonstrations, strikes. Establish control over the media. In some regions of the Soviet Union for six months imposed the state of emergency.</p>
<p>However, the rebels immediately faced strong opposition leadership of the RSFSR, led by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. In defense of democracy were tens of thousands of people in Moscow and other cities of the USSR. Among the defenders of the White House in Moscow by representatives of Ukraine under the blue and yellow flags. Decisive action by Boris Yeltsin, supported by the majority of governments around the world. The rebellion failed.</p>
<p>Mutiny highlighted real, not declarative positions and intentions of all political forces and civil authorities in Ukraine. The management of the Central Committee of the Communist Party was on the side of the rebels. Secretariat of the Central Committee sent to the field shyfrohramu, which frowned upon revolution and party committees were asked to organize support actions DKNS.</p>
<p>Sent to Ukraine General Varennikov said that in case of non-support solutions DKNS, strike, actions of disobedience will be applied troops. Kravchuk and led by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine (which was most of the Communist Party) called for peace and endurance. But while Kravchuk said that any changes should be based on the law and grounds for imposing a state of emergency in the country there.</p>
<p>Consistently and strongly opposed the rebels in Ukraine only -predstavnyky opposition Movement and newly democratic parties. They made a proposal to condemn the revolt of a special decision of the Supreme Soviet. Given the Presidium of the Supreme Council of blocking attempts to give a proper assessment of the DKNS Democrats have launched extensive work among the masses. Began preparations for a strike.</p>
<p>August 24, 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR adopted a historic document - the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, which, inter alia, stated: "The Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic solemnly declares independence of Ukraine and the creation of an independent Ukrainian state - Ukraine. The territory of Ukraine is indivisible and inviolable. From now on the territory of Ukraine in force, the Constitution and laws of Ukraine. "</p>
<p>Thus put an end to the legal existence of the USSR. On the political map of the world, a new sovereign state - Ukraine.</p>
<p>Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, which was the date of adoption of the national holiday of the state, was not a random phenomenon. The quest for national sovereignty tested for centuries. The right to self-determination - the right of people to determine their own destiny.</p>
<p>Thus, the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine - a document of great historical weight that restoring historical justice, was a natural consequence of the development of the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>Under current law at that time, the question of Ukraine's right to self-determination of the people go beyond the competence of Supreme Soviet and was settled by national referendum. Therefore, the same day it was taken and the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR "On the independence of Ukraine", which to be held December 1, 1991 national referendum to confirm the Act of Independence of Ukraine.</p>
<p>A referendum was held in scheduled; 90.32% of people who participated in the referendum question on the ballot for confirmation Act replied, "Yes, I confirm." A positive response gave the population of all regions of Ukraine and Crimea, regardless of their ethnic composition. The results of the referendum showed the desire of the people to be the rightful owner of their own land, not a "younger brother" part of another empire with an updated facade. Election results marked the full entry of Ukraine into the international community of free nations. There was a wave of diplomatic recognition of Ukraine as an independent state.</p>
<p>December 1, 1991 elected the first President of Ukraine of its independent state.</p>
<p>The ballot for the election of the President of Ukraine included six candidates - B. Grinyova, Leonid Kravchuk, L. Lukyanenko, L. Taburyanskoho, Chornovil, I. Yukhnovsky. Candidate for President of Ukraine Oleksandr Tkachenko at the last stage of the struggle, withdrew his candidacy and urged voters to vote for Leonid Kravchuk. The opposition failed to put a single candidate: Movement nominated head of Lviv Regional Council Chornovil, but its leaders Ivan Drach and M. Gorin as the Ukrainian Republican Party, campaigned for the head of PSA L. Lukyanenko, the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine (PDVU ) - the head of the National Council of the Parliament of Ukraine Academician I. Yukhnovsky and with one of the leaders PDVU MP V. Grinyova.</p>
<p>Already in the first round, gaining 61.6% of the vote won by the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, in the recent past, the head of the ideological department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party Leonid Kravchuk. He became the first President of independent Ukraine.</p>
