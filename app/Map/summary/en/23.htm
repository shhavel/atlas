<p>All the troubles that befell Europe in the XIV - XV century., Had a great impact on the church and spiritual life of society. All the expected redemption of sins and Doomsday.

These contradictions led to the flowering of heretical doctrines. This time led by scientists heretics were scholars who were well-known scripture. One of these theologians was Jan Hus (1370 - 1415), Master Charles University, martyrdom which was the impetus for the mighty uprising of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Jan Hus became famous for his lectures and sermons. He knew and loved the common people. In his sermons Hus condemned mess in the church, extortion priests luxurious life senior Church leaders. Huss strongly opposed the sale of indulgences and fees for the celebration of religious rites. He demanded the introduction of stricter punishment for those who bought the church office. Being a patriot of his homeland he opposed the dominance of the Germans in the country (the Czech Republic was part of the Holy Roman Empire, the country was ruled by foreign dynasties, all important government positions occupied by the Germans, too, were the best land owned by German feudal lords). He demanded that the Czechs were masters in their own country, supported the development of Czech culture. He translated the Bible into Czech, which allowed people to get acquainted with the Scriptures. Central to his sermons was that he put the words of Scripture above the authority of the pope and church councils. Being honest and principled, he did not support the papal decree, contrary to Scripture. Thus a conflict of Jan Hus Church became inevitable.</p>

But Catholic theologians did not want to enter into a debate with a heretic, and demanded a simple renunciation. For all requests and belief Gus replied that we should not impose upon him the conviction noose life, forcing him to lie and go against conscience. After all, he was declared a heretic, despite the imperial safe conduct, arrested and thrown into prison. But even that did not break it. He continued to defend their views. The verdict of the cathedral July 6, 1415 Jan Hus was burned at the stake. And all the Czech people were excommunicated from the church.</p>
