<p><b>Natural areas of Ukraine. Flora and fauna</b></p>
<p>Natural Area - a large portion of the earth's surface with the same weather throughout the year, like soil, plants and animals. In most areas the weather affects the amount of heat, and the forms of its surface and the distance from the poles, oceans, deserts. From the temperature changes throughout the year depending wealth of flora area. Since plants are food for animals, it affects the diversity of animals.</p>
<p>The territory of Ukraine is in the range of several natural zones: mixed forests, forest-steppe, steppe, Ukrainian Carpathian and Crimean Mountains. The mountains natural areas vary from bottom to top.</p>
<p>Area of ​​mixed forest occupies the northern part of Ukraine. It is very rich in lakes swamps and rivers. Owing to the large amount of rainfall in this zone of the river flowing.</p>
<p>In the forests of plants grow in tiers. Top - Tree, Medium (underbrush) - bushes, bottom - herbs and mushrooms.
